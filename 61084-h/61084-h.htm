<h3 class="tdc">PREFACE</h3>

<p>It is now thirty years since the &ldquo;Baptist
Church Directory,&ldquo; prepared by the writer,
was first published. That work was designed
to be somewhat of a <i>consensus</i> of
the opinions of those best able to judge in
matters of Baptist church polity and usage,
especially as to what concerns administration
and discipline. It might thus prove a
help to both pastors and members, particularly
in perplexing cases liable to arise.
Thus it was hoped it might help to rectify
the order and customs of our churches
through our widely extended ranks. This
hope has been realized. More than fifty
thousand copies of that book have been circulated
in this country. It has also been
translated, more or less fully, into six or
seven different languages by our missionaries,
<span class="pagenum" id="p4">[p.&nbsp;4]</span>
for use in our missions and foreign
fields.</p>

<p>But many of the churches desired a
smaller and less expensive manual, which
they could put into the hands of all their
members. To meet this want, sixteen years
ago, the writer prepared the little &ldquo;Star
Book on Baptist Church Polity,&rdquo; which
many churches have adopted, furnishing
their members and candidates for membership
with them freely. This has had a circulation
of over thirty thousand copies; and
both this and the &ldquo;Directory&ldquo; are in as
great demand as at any previous time.</p>

<p>It is something more than twenty years
since the &ldquo;Baptist Short Method,&rdquo; by the
same author was published. The purpose
of this manual was to give a concise view
of those distinctive features which mark
the difference between Baptists and other
denominations, especially as to the ordinances
and church order; and also to furnish
the proofs by which our position in
these respects is justified. About ten thousand
<span class="pagenum" id="p5">[p.&nbsp;5]</span>
copies of this book have found their
way into circulation.</p>

<p>The preparation of the present manual
was undertaken at the request of, and by
an arrangement with the pastor, R.&nbsp;S. MacArthur,
D.D., on behalf of Calvary
Baptist Church, New York City, for the
special use of that church. Something was
desired smaller than the &ldquo;Directory,&rdquo; and
more full than the &ldquo;Star Book,&rdquo; embracing
certain features of the &ldquo;Short Method.&rdquo;
When completed, it was thought to be, on
the whole, so much superior to anything
ever before prepared, as a manual for general
use in Baptist churches, that by mutual
consent, it was decided to have it published
for general circulation, rather than confine
it to the use of a single church.</p>

<p>To both ministers and members, such a
manual, it is hoped, will prove a valuable
helper in the interest of church order, and
of denominational unity and prosperity.
Especially for the younger members, so
many thousands of whom are yearly admitted
<span class="pagenum" id="p6">[p.&nbsp;6]</span>
to the fellowship of the churches,
with an unlimited franchise, while but imperfectly
instructed as to either doctrines or
order, it should prove a most valuable assistant.
Concise and accurate in statement of
facts, transparent in arrangement of matters,
convenient in form, and cheap in cost,
pastors will find it to their own advantage,
as well as to that of their members, to see
that their churches are liberally supplied
with copies. The pastor of one of our
very largest and most prosperous churches,
for whose use its preparation was undertaken,
shows his estimate of its value, and
sets other pastors a wise and worthy example,
by ordering in advance of publication,
<i>one thousand copies</i> for his church.</p>

<p>May the Divine blessing make this, as
other works have been made, a means of
furthering good order, spiritual vitality, and
efficient service for Christ, in the churches
for which it is designed.</p>

<h2 class="tdc">STANDARD MANUAL FOR<br />
BAPTIST CHURCHES</h2>

<h3 class="tdc" id="ch1">CHAPTER I</h3>

<p class="tdc"><span class="smcap">a christian church</span></p>

<p>The word &ldquo;church&rdquo; is, in common language,
used with large latitude of meaning.
It is applied to a building used for Christian
worship, to a congregation of Christian
worshipers, to a religious establishment, to
a given form of ecclesiastical order, to the
aggregate of all Christian believers, and to
a local company of Christian disciples associated
in covenant for religious purposes.
The latter is its common use in the New
Testament.</p>

<p>The Greek word <span lang="grc-Latn">ekklesia,</span> rendered
&ldquo;church,&rdquo; is derived from a word meaning
&ldquo;called out,&rdquo; and is used to indicate a company
called out from a larger and more general
<span class="pagenum" id="p10">[p.&nbsp;10]</span>
assembly or concourse of people. In the
free Greek cities, it designated a company
of persons possessed of the rights of citizenship,
and charged with certain important
functions of administration in public affairs,
summoned, or called out, from the common
mass of the people. In the New Testament,
the <span lang="grc-Latn">ekklesia</span> is a company of persons
called out and separated from the common
multitude by a Divine calling, chosen to be
saints, invested with the privileges, and
charged with the duties of citizenship in the
kingdom of Christ.</p>

<p>A Christian Church, therefore, according
to the New Testament idea, is a company
of persons Divinely called and separated
from the world, baptized on a profession of
their faith in Christ, united in covenant for
worship and Christian service, under the
supreme authority of Christ, whose Word is
their only law and rule of life in all matters
of religious faith and practice.</p>

<p>Some Christian denominations include all
their congregations in one comprehensive
society, or ecclesiastical system, under some
central authority, which legislates for and
controls the whole. This comprehensive
society they call the church. Thus we
speak of the Roman Catholic Church, the
<span class="pagenum" id="p11">[p.&nbsp;11]</span>
Episcopal Church, the Presbyterian Church&mdash;where
the word &ldquo;church&rdquo; stands for the
aggregate of all their local societies. With
Baptists it is different. They speak of
Baptist churches, but not of the Baptist
Church, when the entire denomination is
meant. The Baptist Church would mean
some one local congregation of baptized
believers.</p>

<p>Thus was it in Apostolic times. There
was &ldquo;the church in Jerusalem,&rdquo; &ldquo;the
church of the Thessalonians,&rdquo; &ldquo;the church
of Babylon,&rdquo; &ldquo;the church of the Laodiceans&rdquo;;
but &ldquo;the churches of Macedonia,&rdquo;
&ldquo;the churches of Asia,&rdquo; &ldquo;the churches of
Judea.&rdquo; A church, therefore, is not a
system of congregations confederated under
a general government, but a single local
congregation of Christian disciples associated
in covenant and meeting together for
worship. In this sense the word is commonly,
almost uniformly, used in the New
Testament.</p>

<p>Churches are Divinely instituted to be
&ldquo;the light of the world&rdquo; and &ldquo;the salt of
the earth.&rdquo; They are ordained for the
glory of God, as &ldquo;the ground and pillar of
the truth,&rdquo; in the proclamation of His Gospel
and the establishment of His kingdom
<span class="pagenum" id="p12">[p.&nbsp;12]</span>
in the world. They are commissioned to
preach the Gospel to men, and to live the
Gospel before men, that Christ may be
honored and sinners saved. They should,
therefore, be constantly striving to realize
the grand purpose of their existence and
fulfill the mission of their high calling.
That church which does the most to honor
Christ and save man will be the most
honored by Him, and the most influential
and prosperous in all that pertains to the
true functions of a church. And since a
church, as a body, is what its individual
members are in their religious life and influence,
therefore each member should strive
to become in holy living what He desires the
church to be.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note</span> 1.&mdash;A body of Christian disciples may fail to
meet some of the requirements of the Gospel, and
still be a true church of Christ, providing it fulfills
the fundamental conditions of a Scriptural faith and
practice.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note</span> 2.&mdash;But when a body ceases to acknowledge
and submit to Christ as its Supreme Ruler, and to
receive His Word as its supreme law, then it ceases to
be a true church, and is simply a religious society,
though it may still accept some of His doctrines and
practice some of His precepts.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note</span> 3.&mdash;A church is not a legislative, but an
executive body. It cannot make laws, but only obey
and administer those which Christ has given in the
New Testament. He is the only Lawmaker in Zion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="p13">[p.&nbsp;13]</span>
<span class="smcap">Note</span> 4.&mdash;But in matters pertaining to order and
methods of administration, merely optional and discretionary,
not involving fundamental principles, the
church is to exercise its liberty, so long as it does not
contravene Scriptural teaching or infringe the rights
of its members.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note</span> 5.&mdash;And still further, while a church cannot
become an authoritative expounder of either truth or
duty, to bind the consciences even of its members,
yet it does possess a judicial function for the interpretation
and the enforcement of the laws of Christ
for itself as a body, and, therefore, for its members,
so far as their relation to the compact is concerned.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note</span> 6.&mdash;Each church owes courtesy and comity,
fellowship and fraternity, to all others; but it owes
subjection and allegiance to none, and is under authority
to Christ alone.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note</span> 7.&mdash;In matters of business and in the exercise
of its authority in administration, the will of the
church is expressed by a majority vote of its members.
But the nearer that majority approaches to
unanimity, the more satisfactory and emphatic are
its decisions.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note</span> 8.&mdash;Councils may be called, presbyteries convened,
or committees of reference chosen for advice
in cases of moment, but they are all <i>advisory</i> only,
and in no case authoritative. There is no higher,
and no other court of appeal in ecclesiastical affairs,
than the individual church.</p>

<h3 class="tdc" id="ch2">CHAPTER II</h3>

<p class="tdc"><span class="smcap">church officers<a id="ch2_fna1"></a>
<a class="fnanchor" href="#ch2_fn1">[1]</a></span></p>

<p>The Scriptural officers of a church are
<i>bishops</i> and <i>deacons.</i> Bishops are in the
New Testament also called &ldquo;presbyters,&rdquo;
&ldquo;elders,&rdquo; and &ldquo;overseers.&rdquo; Their duties
and services have mainly reference to the
spiritual interests of the body, though they
properly have the oversight of all its concerns.
The deacons have principal charge
of the temporalities of the church, so as to
relieve the pastor in that department of
labor. They are, however, to be counselors
and helpers of the pastor in all departments
of his work. The qualifications for both
offices are set forth in the Epistles to
Timothy and Titus.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note</span> 1.&mdash;Pastors and deacons, as teachers and
leaders of the flock, cannot be selected for and imposed
upon the churches by any external authority
whatever, either civic or religious; but are elected
<span class="pagenum" id="p15">[p.&nbsp;15]</span>
and chosen by the free suffrages of the members,
without compulsion or restraint, from among themselves,
or those who are to become identified with
them in fellowship.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note</span> 2.&mdash;In the election of either a pastor or
deacon, notice of such election should be given from
the pulpit for at least two Sundays preceding the
time for the same. The election should be by ballot,
and at least <i>three-quarters</i> of the votes cast should be
necessary for the election of a pastor, and <i>two-thirds</i>
for the election of a deacon. Such election should
be preceded by prayer for Divine direction, and conducted
without partisan devices or personal strife.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note</span> 3.&mdash;Both pastors and deacons are properly
elected for unlimited terms of service, the relation to
continue so long as there shall be mutual satisfaction.
Such a course tends less to depreciate and make
servile the officers and their duties in the estimation
of the people, and of those who bear them, than a
limited and specified time, though deacons are sometimes,
and perhaps properly, chosen for a limited term
of service, subject to reelection, at the option of the
church.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note</span> 4.&mdash;The church is to fix on the amount of
salary necessary to a generous support of the pastor,
and hold itself obligated by every consideration of
Christian honor for the prompt and regular payment
of the same. To fail in this is as dishonorable to the
church as it is unjust and vexatious to the pastor.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note</span> 5.&mdash;The call to a pastor issues from the
<i>church</i> as a body, which also designates the amount
of salary to be paid. It is in some sections usual,
though not essential, to have subsequently a meeting
of the entire congregation or society to approve or
confirm the call. In some States it is necessary for
the trustees, as the legal representatives of the corporation,
to confirm the action officially, so far as the
salary is concerned, before it can become legal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="p16">[p.&nbsp;16]</span>
<span class="smcap">Note</span> 6.&mdash;The number of deacons is optional with
the church. It is usually from <i>three</i> to <i>seven.</i> Let it
be so many as the church needs and can find suitable
as candidates for the office. But they should never be
elected simply to fill the office, and never unless they
be persons whose fitness for the office is generally
conceded.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note</span> 7.&mdash;The relations between pastor and the
church may be dissolved at the option of either, by
giving <i>three months&rsquo;</i> notice; or otherwise, by mutual
consent. Between the deacons and the church, the
relations may be dissolved at the option of either
without previous notice.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note</span> 8.&mdash;A church <i>clerk</i> is elected annually, at a
business meeting, by a majority vote. It is an office
of convenience, for keeping the minutes and preserving
the records of the body. Also <i>trustees</i> are elected
by the church, or if the law so requires, by a <i>society.</i>
Their duties are the care of the property and the
management of finances. But these are not considered
Scriptural church officers; deacons might properly
discharge all the functions of these
<span class="wsnw">offices.<a id="ch2_fna2"></a><a class="fnanchor" href="#ch2_fn2">[2]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note</span> 9.&mdash;The offices of trust and service in a
church should be as widely distributed among the
<span class="pagenum" id="p17">[p.&nbsp;17]</span>
members as possible, consistently with the welfare of
the body. This rule should seldom be disregarded.
No one man should hold more than one office at the
same time, unless the interests of the body absolutely
demand it. If offices are honors, they should be
widely dispensed; if they are burdens, they certainly
should be. For the same man to hold two or three
offices is as unjust to him as it is to his brethren.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note</span> 10.&mdash;A church cannot unite in any corporate
capacity with other organizations for religious, benevolent,
moral reform, or other purposes; but it may
cooperate with these for any good object, and give to
such societies its moral support, sympathy, and pecuniary
aid.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note</span> 11.&mdash;But members of churches can, as individuals,
unite with outside organizations, for any
purpose, not inconsistent with their profession as
Christians, and not injurious to their church relations
and duties.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note</span> 12.&mdash;Churches cannot alienate their responsibilities,
nor delegate their authority to any man, or
to any body of men, to act officially for them. But
they can appoint persons to bear messages, and to
perform services for them, under instruction, and to
report their action to the body.</p>

In some States the laws do not recognize the church, that
being a spiritual body, but incorporate a <i>society,</i> as it is called,
consisting of all persons of full age who attend and support
the worship. This society has charge of the financial affairs
of the church, holds and keeps in repair its property, and conducts
its secular concerns. It elects a specified number of
<i>trustees,</i> as provided for by law, who are the legal representatives
of the corporation. The members of the society, and the
trustees elected, may or may not be members of the church.
This whole society arrangement is a relic of the old New
England parish system of the standing order, and is inconsistent
with the freedom of church action, and antagonistic to
Baptist Church independence. It is anti-Baptistic and anti-Scriptural.
A church should be allowed to manage its own
affairs, both temporal and spiritual: and should be protected
by law in doing so. The society system has been abrogated in
most of the States.</p></div>

<h3 id="ch3" class="tdc">CHAPTER III</h3>

<p class="tdc"><span class="smcap">church ordinances</span></p>

<p>Christian ordinances, in the largest
sense, are any institutions, or regulations of
Divine appointment, established as means of
grace for the good of men, or as acts of
worship for the honor of God. In that
sense, not only are baptism and the Lord&rsquo;s
Supper ordinances, but preaching, prayer,
hearing the Word, fasting, and thanksgiving
are also ordinances, since all are of Divine
appointment. But, in a narrower sense, it is
common to say that <i>baptism</i> and the <i>Lord&rsquo;s
Supper</i> are the only ordinances appointed
by Christ to be observed by His churches.
These are the only emblematic and commemorative
rites enjoined upon His disciples,
by which they are to be distinguished, and
He is to be honored. They are the two
symbols and witnesses of the New Covenant,
the two monuments of the New Dispensation.</p>

<p><i>Baptism</i> is the immersion, or dipping, of
<span class="pagenum" id="p19">[p.&nbsp;19]</span>
a candidate in water, on a profession of his
faith in Christ and on evidence of regeneration;
the baptism to be ministered in, or
into, the name of the Father, the Son, and
Holy Spirit. It represents the burial and
resurrection of Christ, and in a figure declares
the candidate&rsquo;s death to sin and the
world, and his rising to a new life. It also
proclaims the washing of regeneration, and
professes the candidate&rsquo;s hope of a resurrection
from the dead, through Him into the
likeness of whose death he is buried in baptism.</p>

<p><i>The Lord&rsquo;s Supper</i> is a provision of bread
and wine, used to represent the body and
the blood of Christ, partaken of by members
of the church assembled for that purpose;
in which service they commemorate
the love of Christ exhibited in His death for
them, and profess their faith and participation
in the merits of His sacrifice, as the only
ground of their hope of eternal life.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note</span> 1.&mdash;No person can rightfully or properly become
a church-member except he be first baptized, as
the distinguishing mark and profession of his discipleship.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note</span> 2.&mdash;The Supper is a church ordinance, and
therefore is the privilege of church-members only.
Therefore, also, since baptism precedes church-membership,
it must precede and be prerequisite to the
Lord&rsquo;s Supper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="p20">[p.&nbsp;20]</span>
<span class="smcap">Note</span> 3.&mdash;Since the Supper is distinctively a church
ordinance, it is to be observed by churches only, and
not by individuals; neither in private places, nor in
sick-rooms, nor on social occasions, and not by companies
of disciples other than churches. But a church
may by appointment, and in its official capacity, meet
in a private house, a sick-room, or wherever it may
elect, and there observe the Supper.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note</span> 4.&mdash;Both ordinances are ordinarily and properly
administered by ordained and accredited ministers;
but both would be equally valid if administered
by unordained persons, should occasion require and
the church so direct. As to the qualifications of the
administrator, the New Testament is silent, except
that he should be a disciple.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note</span> 5.&mdash;As to the time, place, and frequency of
the ordinances, no Scriptural directions are given.
These are left optional with the churches. They are
usually observed on Sundays, but not necessarily.
As to the Supper, our churches have very generally
come to observe it on the first Sunday of each month.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note</span> 6.&mdash;The participation of the elements in the
Supper should be done according to the special direction
of Christ, the Head of the body. &ldquo;This do in
remembrance of <i>Me.</i>&rdquo; It is not, therefore, a test or
token of Christian fellowship, except incidentally.
All thought and sympathy in the service should be
centered on Him who is &ldquo;the living bread,&rdquo; and not
fixed on others.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note</span> 7.&mdash;The ordinances are not <i>sacraments,</i> as
taught by some, conveying effectual grace to the soul
and imparting spiritual life. But as Divinely appointed
means of grace, their importance must not
be undervalued. They cannot be neglected without
suffering serious harm and incurring the gravest responsibility.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note</span> 8.&mdash;Baptism is not essential to salvation, for
our churches utterly repudiate the dogma of &ldquo;baptismal
<span class="pagenum" id="p21">[p.&nbsp;21]</span>
regeneration&rdquo;; but it is essential to obedience,
since Christ has commanded it. It is also essential to
a public confession of Christ before the world, and to
membership in the church which is His body. And no
true lover of his Lord will refuse these acts of
obedience and tokens of affection.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<span class="pagenum" id="p22">[p.&nbsp;22]</span></p>
<h3 class="tdc" id="ch4">CHAPTER IV</h3>

<p class="tdc"><span class="smcap">church-membership</span></p>

<p>It is most likely that in the Apostolic age
when there was but &ldquo;one Lord, one faith,
and one baptism,&rdquo; and no differing denominations
existed, the baptism of a convert
by that very act constituted him a member
of the church, and at once endowed him
with all the rights and privileges of full
membership. In that sense, &ldquo;baptism was
the door into the church.&rdquo; Now, it is
different; and while the churches are desirous
of receiving members, they are wary
and cautious that they do not receive unworthy
persons. The churches therefore
have candidates come before them, make
their statement, give their &ldquo;experience,&rdquo;
and then their reception is decided by a
vote of the members. And while they cannot
become members without baptism, yet
it is the vote of the body which admits
them to its fellowship on receiving baptism.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="p23">[p.&nbsp;23]</span>
There are <i>three classes</i> of candidates, and
modes of reception to membership.</p>

<p>1. <i>By baptism.</i>&mdash;The church having listened
to the religious experience of the candidate,
and being satisfied with the same,
and with his Christian deportment, votes to
receive him to its fellowship, &ldquo;on being
baptized.&rdquo;</p>

<p>2. <i>By letter.</i>&mdash;The candidate presents a
letter of dismission and recommendation
from some other Baptist church with which
he has been connected, for the purpose of
transferring his membership to this. The
church, being satisfied, votes to receive him
into fellowship.</p>

<p>3. <i>By experience.</i>&mdash;Persons having been
baptized, but for some reason being without
membership in any church, wish to be
received. They, giving satisfactory evidence
of Christian character, and substantial
agreement in matters of faith and practice,
are received by vote, as in other cases.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note</span> 1.&mdash;Persons cannot be received to membership
on the credit of letters from other denominations.
Such letters are, however, accepted, as
certificates of Christian character, and of church
standing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note</span> 2.&mdash;While the churches do not require candidates
to sign any creed, confession, or articles of
faith, yet they do expect a substantial agreement in
<span class="pagenum" id="p24">[p.&nbsp;24]</span>
matters of faith and practice on their part as essential
both to the comfort of the individual, and the harmony
of the body.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note</span> 3.&mdash;Should any member object to the reception
of a candidate, such reception should be deferred,
in order to consider the reasons for the objection.
Objections judged groundless or unreasonable should
not prevent the reception of a suitable candidate; yet
no one should be received except by a unanimous or
nearly unanimous vote.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note</span> 4.&mdash;It is customary for candidates, after their
experience or letters have been presented, to retire
while the church deliberates and acts upon their case.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note</span> 5.&mdash;Any member in good standing, is entitled,
at any time, to a letter of dismission, in the usual
form, with which to unite with another church of the
same faith and order.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note</span> 6.&mdash;Letters are usually made valid for <i>six
months</i> only, during which time they must be used, if
used at all. But if held longer, they may be renewed
by the church, if satisfactory reasons are given for
their non-use.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note</span> 7.&mdash;Each one receiving a letter is still a
member of the church, and under its watchcare and
discipline, until his letter is actually received by
another church.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note</span> 8.&mdash;Letters cannot be given to members for
the purpose of uniting with churches with which we
are not in fellowship. But any member is entitled,
at any time, to receive a certificate of standing, and
Christian character.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note</span> 9.&mdash;No member can <i>withdraw</i> from the
church, or have his name <i>dropped,</i> or at his own
request be <i>excluded</i> from the fellowship of the body
without due process of discipline.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note</span> 10.&mdash;Nor can a member have a letter voted
and forced upon him without his wish and consent.
<span class="pagenum" id="p25">[p.&nbsp;25]</span>
Such would be a virtual expulsion from the body. If
worthy to receive a letter, he cannot be forced out of
the church against his will.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note</span> 11.&mdash;Members living remote from the church
are expected to unite with some Baptist church near
their residence; or give satisfactory reasons for not
doing so. When they cannot so unite, they are expected
to report themselves to the church at least
<i>once each year,</i> and contribute to its support, till they
cease to be members.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note</span> 12.&mdash;Letters of dismission may be revoked,
at any time before being used, if, in the judgment of
the church, there be sufficient cause for such action.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note</span> 13.&mdash;Church fellowship will be withdrawn
from members who unite with other denominations;
because, however excellent their character, or sincere
their intentions, they have broken covenant with the
church, and by such act have placed themselves beyond
the limits of its fellowship.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note</span> 14.&mdash;Persons excluded from other churches
are not to be received to membership, except after the
most careful investigation of all the facts in the
case, and not unless it be manifest that the exclusion
was unjustifiable, and that the church excluding persistently
refuses to do justice to the excluded member.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note</span> 15.&mdash;A letter is usually asked for and addressed
to the particular church. This is proper, but
not always necessary. It may in certain cases be
asked for, and given &ldquo;to the church of the same
faith and order.&rdquo; Or if directed to one, it may be
presented to, and received by another.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note</span> 16.&mdash;It is expected that all pecuniary liability
to the church will be canceled, and all personal difficulties
in the church will be settled by a member,
should such exist, before he shall receive a letter of
dismission.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note</span> 17.&mdash;Each member, without exception, is expected
to fill his place in the church, by attendance
<span class="pagenum" id="p26">[p.&nbsp;26]</span>
on its appointments, as Providence may allow, and
also to contribute of his means for the pecuniary
support of the body, according to his ability. If in
either of these respects he fails, and refuses, he becomes
a covenant-breaker, and is subject to the discipline
of the body.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note</span> 18.&mdash;Persons excluded from the church may
be again received to its fellowship on satisfactory
evidence of fitness. This is called reception by <i>restoration,</i>
and is usually so entered on the records, and
in associational reports.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note</span> 19.&mdash;It is neither a Christian nor an honorable
course for a church to grant an unworthy member
a valid letter, and send him to another church as
one in good and regular standing, in order to be rid
of a disturber of the peace, or to avoid the trouble of
a course of discipline.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note</span> 20.&mdash;No church is <i>obliged</i> to receive a person
to membership, simply because he brings a valid
letter from another church. Each church is to be
sole judge of the qualifications of persons to be
received to its fellowship.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<span class="pagenum" id="p27">[p.&nbsp;27]</span></p>
<h3 id="ch5" class="tdc">CHAPTER V</h3>

<p class="tdc"><span class="smcap">church discipline</span></p>

<p>Church-members are supposed to be regenerate
persons bearing the image and
cherishing the spirit of Christ, in whom the
peace of God rules, and who walk and
work in &ldquo;the unity of the Spirit, and the
bond of peace.&rdquo; But unhappily, even the
saints are sanctified only in part, and
troubles sometimes arise among brethren.
The evil passions of even good men may
triumph over piety, and partisan strife may
destroy the peace and the prosperity of the
body of Christ. All this should, if possible,
be avoided. Corrective discipline seeks
to heal offenses; but it is better to <i>prevent</i>
them, than to <i>heal</i> them. It is, however,
better to heal and remove, than to endure
them.</p>

<p>Now these offenses and occasions of dissension
in the churches arise from various
causes, and are largely preventable. Most
frequently they come by the following
means:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="p28">[p.&nbsp;28]</span>
1. Because of the too suspicious and
sensitive disposition of some who imagine
themselves wronged, neglected, or in some
way injured; the matter being chiefly imaginary,
and without any real foundation in
fact.</p>

<p>2. Because the pastor, deacons, and influential
members do not carefully and constantly
enough watch the beginnings of
strife, and rectify the evil before it becomes
serious.</p>

<p>3. Because evil-doers by delay become
more persistent in evil, while others are
drawn into the strife, and contentious parties
insensibly are formed, which tend to divide
the church into hostile factions.</p>

<p>4. Because that when the difficulty becomes
chronic and deep-seated, the church
is likely to undertake the discipline with
judicial severity, and not in the spirit of
meekness, in which the spiritual should restore
the erring.</p>

<p>5. Because that a case of discipline undertaken
under excitement is almost certain
to be wrongly conducted. Even if the result
reached be just and right, the method by
which it is reached is likely to be unwise,
unjust, and oppressive to individuals, possibly
<span class="pagenum" id="p29">[p.&nbsp;29]</span>
producing more serious and more lasting
evils than it has removed.</p>

<p><i>Offenses</i> calling for discipline are usually
considered as of <i>two</i> classes: <i>private</i> or personal,
and <i>public</i> or general. These terms
do not very accurately express the nature of
the offenses, but they are in common use,
and capable of being understood. In the
administration of <i>corrective discipline,</i> the
following rules and principles constitute a
correct and Scriptural course of proceeding:</p>

<p class="cgap"><span class="smcap">private offenses</span></p>

<p><i>Private offenses</i> pertain to personal difficulties
between individuals, having no direct
reference to the church as a body, and not
involving the Christian profession at large.
In such cases, the course prescribed by
our Saviour (Matt. <span class="wsnw">18:15</span>&ndash;17) is to be
strictly followed, without question or deviation.</p>

<p>1. <i>First step.</i>&mdash;The member who considers
himself injured must go to the
offender, tell him his grief, and between
themselves alone, if possible, adjust and
settle the difficulty. &ldquo;If thy brother shall
trespass against thee, go and tell him his
fault, between thee and him alone.&rdquo; This
<span class="pagenum" id="p30">[p.&nbsp;30]</span>
must be done, not to charge, upbraid, or
condemn the offender, but to win him. &ldquo;If
he shall hear thee, thou hast gained thy
brother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>2. <i>Second step.</i>&mdash;If this shall fail, then
the offended member must take one or two
of the brethren with him as witnesses, seek
an interview with the offender, and, if possible,
by their united wisdom and piety,
remove the offense and harmonize the difficulty.
&ldquo;But if he will not hear thee, then
take with thee one or two more, that in the
mouth of two or three witnesses, every word
may be established.&rdquo;</p>

<p>3. <i>Third step.</i>&mdash;If this step should prove
unavailing, then the offended member must
tell the whole matter to the <i>church,</i> and
leave it in their hands to be disposed of, as
to them may seem wisest and best. &ldquo;And
if he shall neglect to hear them, tell it to
the church.&rdquo; He has done his duty and
must abide by the decision of the body
which assumes this responsibility.</p>

<p>4. <i>The result.</i>&mdash;If this course of kindly
Christian labor proves finally ineffectual,
and the offender shows himself incorrigible,
excision must follow. He must be cut off
from fellowship in the church whose covenant
he has broken, and whose authority
<span class="pagenum" id="p31">[p.&nbsp;31]</span>
he disregards. &ldquo;And if he neglect to hear
the church, let him be unto thee as an
heathen man, and a publican.&rdquo; However
painful the act, the church must be faithful
to its duty, and to its God.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note</span> 1.&mdash;While this Divine rule makes it obligatory
on the offended member to go to the offender and
seek a reconciliation, yet much more is it obligatory
on the offender who knows that a brother is grieved
with him, to seek such an one, and try to remove the
difficulty.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note</span> 2.&mdash;The matter is not to be made public until
these three steps have been fully taken, and have
failed; and then to be made public only by telling
the church, and no others.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note</span> 3.&mdash;When the case comes before the church,
it must not be neglected nor dropped, but judiciously
pursued until the difficulty be adjusted, the offense
removed, or else the offender be disfellowshipped,
and put away.</p>

<p class="cgap"><span class="smcap">public offenses</span></p>

<p><i>Public offenses</i> are not against any one
person more than another, but are such as
are supposed to be a dishonor to the church
of which the offender is a member, and a
reproach to the Christian profession. They
constitute a violation of the code of Christian
morals, if not of our common worldly
morals.</p>

<p>The more common causes of this class of
offenses are the following: False doctrine
<span class="pagenum" id="p32">[p.&nbsp;32]</span>
(Gal. <span class="wsnw">1:9,</span> 2&nbsp;John 10), disregard of authority
(Matt. <span class="wsnw">18:17;</span> 1&nbsp;Thess. <span class="wsnw">5:14),</span>
contention and strife (Rom. <span class="wsnw">16:17),</span> immoral
conduct (1&nbsp;Cor. <span class="wsnw">5:11),</span> disorderly
walk (2&nbsp;Thess. <span class="wsnw">3:6,</span> 9), covetous spirit
(Eph. <span class="wsnw">5:5;</span> 1&nbsp;Cor. <span class="wsnw">5:11),</span> arrogant
conduct (3&nbsp;John 9), going to law (1&nbsp;Cor.
<span class="wsnw">6:6).</span></p>

<p>The following constitutes a proper and
Scriptural course of treatment for such
cases:</p>

<p>1. The first member who has knowledge
of the offense should, as in the case of private
offenses, seek the offender, ascertain
the facts, and attempt to reconcile or remove
the difficulty. Not till he has done this
should he make it public, or bring it before
the church.</p>

<p>2. But if no one will, or can, pursue this
course of personal effort, or if such a course
proves unsuccessful, then any member having
knowledge of the facts should confer
with the pastor and deacons as to the best
course to be pursued.</p>

<p>3. The pastor and deacons should, by the
best method they are capable of devising,
labor to adjust the matter without bringing
it into the church, or otherwise making it
public.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="p33">[p.&nbsp;33]</span>
4. But if their efforts fail, or if the case
be already public, and a reproach and scandal
to religion, then they should bring it to
the church, and it should direct a proper
course of discipline.</p>

<p>5. The church, thus having the case before
it, should either appoint a committee
to visit the offender, or cite him before the
body to answer the charge. He should be
allowed to hear the evidence against him,
know the witnesses, and be permitted to answer
for himself.</p>

<p>6. If the accused disproves the charges,
or if he confesses the wrong, makes suitable
acknowledgment, and, so far as possible,
reparation, with promise of amendment,
in all ordinary cases, this should be
deemed satisfactory, and the case be dismissed.</p>

<p>7. But if, after patient, deliberate, and
prayerful labor, all efforts fail to reclaim
the offender, then, however painful the necessity,
the church must withdraw its fellowship
from him, and put him away from
them.</p>

<p>8. If the case be one of flagrant immorality,
by which the reputation of the body
is compromised and the Christian name
scandalized, on being proved or confessed,
<span class="pagenum" id="p34">[p.&nbsp;34]</span>
the hand of fellowship may be at once withdrawn
from the offender, notwithstanding
any confessions and promises of amendment;
but not without a trial.</p>

<p>The church&rsquo;s good name and the honor
of religion demand this testimony against
evil. He may be subsequently restored, if
suitably penitent.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note</span> 1.&mdash;All discipline should be conducted in the
spirit of Christian meekness and love, with a desire
to remove offenses and win offenders. It must also be
done under a deep sense of responsibility to maintain
the honor of Christ&rsquo;s name, the purity of His church,
and the integrity of His truth.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note</span> 2.&mdash;If any member shall persist in bringing a
private grievance before the church, or otherwise
make it public before he has pursued the course prescribed
in the eighteenth chapter of Matthew, he
becomes himself an offender, and subject to the discipline
of the body.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note</span> 3.&mdash;When private difficulties exist among
members which they cannot, or will not settle, the
church should consider them as public offenses, and
as such dispose of them, rather than suffer the perpetual
injury which they inflict.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note</span> 4.&mdash;When a member refers to the church any
private difficulty, which he has been unable to settle,
he must submit it wholly to the disposition of the
body, and abide by its decision. If he attempts to
revive and prosecute it beyond the decision of the
church, he becomes an offender, and subject to discipline.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note</span> 5.&mdash;Any member tried by the church has the
right to receive copies of all charges against him, the
<span class="pagenum" id="p35">[p.&nbsp;35]</span>
names of his accusers, and the witnesses, both of
whom he shall have the privilege of meeting face
to face, hearing their statements, bringing witnesses
on his side, and answering for himself before the
body.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note</span> 6.&mdash;Every member on trial or excluded, shall
have furnished at his request, authentic copies of all
proceedings had by the church in his case, officially
certified.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note</span> 7.&mdash;No member under discipline can have
the right to bring any person, not a member, before
the church as his advocate, except by consent of the
body.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note</span> 8.&mdash;In every case of exclusion, the charges
against the member, and the reasons for his exclusion,
should be accurately entered on the records of
the church.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note</span> 9.&mdash;If at any time it shall become apparent,
or seem probable to the church that it has for any
reason dealt unjustly with a member, or excluded him
without sufficient cause, it should at once, and without
request by concession and restoration, so far as
possible, repair the injury it has done him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note</span> 10.&mdash;The church should hold itself bound to
restore to its fellowship an excluded member when,
ever he gives satisfactory evidence of repentance and
reformation consistent with godliness.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note</span> 11.&mdash;The church will exercise is legitimate
authority, and vindicate its honor and rectitude in
the administration of discipline, even though the
member should regard such discipline as unjust or
oppressive.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note</span> 12.&mdash;Nothing can be considered a just and
reasonable cause for discipline, except what is forbidden
by the letter of the spirit of Scripture. And
<span class="pagenum" id="p36">[p.&nbsp;36]</span>
nothing can be considered a sufficient cause for disfellowship
and exclusion, except what is clearly contrary
to Scripture, and what would have prevented
the reception of the person into the church, had it
been known to exist at the time of his reception.</p>

<h3 id="ch6" class="tdc">CHAPTER VI</h3>

<p class="tdc"><span class="smcap">cases of appeal</span></p>

<p>Cases of difficulty and discipline do sometimes
occur, so aggravated in their nature
or so complicated in their treatment that it
is found impossible to make a satisfactory
settlement by ordinary methods; especially
so if discipline has ended in exclusion. The
excluded member will be almost sure to
think he has been dealt with unjustly, and
will wish for some redress; and if the case
has been of long standing and much complicated,
he will be equally sure to have
others sympathize with him and condemn
the action of the church. Now, although
the <i>presumption</i> is that the church has done
right, and is justified in its action, the <i>possibility</i>
is that the church has done wrong,
and is censurable for its action.</p>

<p>What can be done in such a case?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note</span> 1.&mdash;On the New Testament theory of church
government, the action of this individual local church
is final. There is no power either civil or ecclesiastical,
<span class="pagenum" id="p38">[p.&nbsp;38]</span>
that can reverse its decision or punish it for
wrong-doing. It may make mistakes, but no human
tribunal has authority to compel it to confess or correct
them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note</span> 2.&mdash;Councils, if appealed to for redress, have
<i>no authority;</i> they are simply, always, and everywhere
<i>advisory</i>&mdash;that, and nothing more. They can
express an opinion, and give advice; but they have
no authority to issue decrees, and would have no
power to enforce them if they should.<a id="ch6_fna1"></a><a class="fnanchor" href="#ch6_fn1">[1]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note</span> 3.&mdash;Any person who believes himself wronged
by church action has the inalienable right to appeal
to the church for a new hearing, and, failing in this,
to ask the counsel and advice of brethren, should he
see fit to do so.</p>

<p><i>Now observe</i>&mdash;If an excluded member
believes himself unjustly dealt by, and
wishes redress the following is the proper
course for him to pursue:</p>

<p>1. Apply to the church which excluded,
and ask a rehearing. State to them the
grounds of his complaint and the evidence
on which he thinks he can satisfy them, if
a fair opportunity for being heard be given
him.</p>

<p>2. If they refuse him a rehearing, let
him appeal to them to unite with him in
calling a <i>mutual council,</i> before which the
<span class="pagenum" id="p39">[p.&nbsp;39]</span>
whole case shall be placed, all parties to
abide by its decision.</p>

<p>3. If a mutual council be declined by
the church, he would be fully justified,
should he feel so inclined, in calling an <span lang="la">ex-parte</span>
council, before which he should place
the facts and seek its advice.</p>

<p>4. Or, instead of calling an <span lang="la">ex-parte</span> council,
he could apply to some other church to
be received to its fellowship, on the ground
that he had been unjustly excluded. Should
he be received to another church, that would
give him church standing and fellowship
again, and vindicate him so far as any ecclesiastical
action could vindicate him.</p>

<p>5. If all these resorts fail, there is nothing
left but for him to wait patiently, and
bear the burden of his wrong until Providence
opens the way for his deliverance.
He may, after all, conclude that he himself
was more in fault than he at first supposed,
and the church less so.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note</span> 4.&mdash;An <span lang="la">ex-parte</span> council should not be called
in such a case of difficulty until all efforts have failed
to secure a <i>mutual</i> council; as such a council, if
called, would probably do nothing more than advise
a mutual council and adjourn.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note</span> 5.&mdash;Any church can well afford to grant a
rehearing to an excluded member. It would be in
the interest of peace, justice, and reconciliation. If
the church be right, it can afford to be generous.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="p40">[p.&nbsp;40]</span>
<span class="smcap">Note</span> 6.&mdash;Any church has the right to receive a
member excluded, from another church, since each
church is sole judge of the qualification of persons
received to its fellowship. But any church so appealed
to would use great caution, and with due
regard to its own peace and purity, ascertain all the
facts in the case before taking such action.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note</span> 7.&mdash;If a mutual council be called, one-half
the messengers and members are to be chosen by the
church and one-half by the aggrieved party; but the
<i>letters missive</i> calling the council are to be sent out
by and in the name of the church, and not of the
aggrieved party. But these facts, as to the mutual
call, are to be stated in the letters.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note</span> 8.&mdash;A church excluding a member has no
just cause of complaint against another church for
receiving such an excluded member, since the one
church is just as independent to receive one whom it
judges worthy of fellowship, as the other is to exclude
one whom it judged unworthy of fellowship.</p>

<h3 id="ch7" class="tdc">CHAPTER VII</h3>

<p class="tdc"><span class="smcap">church business</span></p>

<p>The business meetings of a church should
be conducted as much as possible in the
spirit of devotion, and under a sense of the
propriety and sanctity which attaches to all
the interests of the kingdom of Christ.
Meetings for business should not be needlessly
multiplied, nor should they be unwisely
neglected. It may not be wise to
insist too rigidly on the observance of parliamentary
rules, yet it is still worse to drift
into a loose unbusinesslike way, which
wastes time, accomplishes little, and does
wrongly much that is done.</p>

<p class="cgap"><span class="smcap">order of business</span></p>

<p>1. The meetings to be opened with reading
the Scriptures, singing, and prayer.</p>

<p>2. The reading, correction, and approval
of the minutes of the preceding meeting.</p>

<p>3. Unfinished business, or such as the
<span class="pagenum" id="p42">[p.&nbsp;42]</span>
minutes present, including reports of committees
taken in order.</p>

<p>4. New business will next be taken up.
Any member may call up new business.
But important matters should not be presented,
except on previous consultation with
the pastor and deacons.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note</span> 1.&mdash;The pastor is, by virtue of his office, moderator
of all church business meetings. If he be not
present, or do not wish to serve, any one may be
elected to take the place.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note</span> 2.&mdash;All business meetings, both regular and
special, should be announced from the pulpit one
Sunday, at least, before they are held.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note</span> 3.&mdash;Special meetings for business may be
called at any time, by consent of the pastor and deacons,
or by such other methods as the church itself
may direct.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note</span> 4.&mdash;Though a majority usually decides questions,
yet in all matters of special importance a unanimous,
or nearly unanimous, vote should be secured.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note</span> 5.&mdash;Members may be received, and letters of
dismission granted, either at the business church
meeting, the covenant meeting, or the regular weekly
prayer meeting, the church so directing. Some fixed method
should be observed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note</span> 6.&mdash;Candidates for admission to membership
will be expected to retire from the meeting
when action is taken on their reception.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note</span> 7.&mdash;No persons, except members, will be
present during the transaction of church business. If
present, they may be asked to retire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="p43">[p.&nbsp;43]</span>
<span class="smcap">Note</span> 8.&mdash;Although the church should endeavor to
do nothing which its members will be ashamed or
afraid to have known by others, yet every member is
bound, by the honor of a Christian, not to publish
abroad, nor disclose to those without, the private
affairs and business transactions of the body.</p>

<p class="cgap"><span class="smcap">rules of order</span></p>

<p>The following constitute the generally
accepted rules of order for churches and
other deliberative bodies in business proceedings:</p>

<p class="cgap"><i>Motions</i></p>

<p>1. All business shall be presented by a
<i>motion,</i> made by one member, and seconded
by another, and presented in writing by the
mover, if so required.</p>

<p>2. No discussion can properly be had until
the motion is made, seconded, and stated by
the chairman.</p>

<p>3. A motion cannot be withdrawn after
it has been discussed, except by the unanimous
consent of the body.</p>

<p>4. A motion having been discussed, must
be put to vote, unless withdrawn, laid on
the table, referred, or postponed.</p>

<p>5. A motion lost should not be recorded,
except so ordered by the body at the time.</p>

<p>6. A motion lost cannot be renewed at the
same meeting, except by unanimous consent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="p44">[p.&nbsp;44]</span>
7. A motion should contain but one distinct
proposition. If it contains more, it
must be divided at the request of any member,
and the propositions acted on separately.</p>

<p>8. Only one question can properly be before
the meeting at any one time. No second
motion can be allowed to interrupt one
already under debate, except a motion to
<i>amend,</i> to <i>substitute,</i> to <i>commit,</i> to <i>postpone,</i>
to <i>lay on the table,</i> for <i>the previous question,</i>
or to <i>adjourn.</i></p>

<p>9. These subsidiary motions just named
cannot be interrupted by any other motion;
nor can any other motion be applied to
them except that to <i>amend,</i> which may be
done by specifying some <i>time, place,</i> or <i>purpose.</i></p>

<p>10. Nor can these motions interrupt or
supersede each other; only that a motion to
<i>adjourn</i> is always in order, except while a
member has the floor, or a question is being
taken, and in some bodies even then.</p>

<p class="cgap"><i>Amendments</i></p>

<p>1. Amendments to resolutions may be
made in three ways: By <i>omitting,</i> by <i>adding,</i>
or by <i>substituting</i> words or sentences.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="p45">[p.&nbsp;45]</span>
2. An amendment to an amendment may
be made, but is seldom necessary, and should
be avoided.</p>

<p>3. No amendment should be made which
essentially changes the meaning or design
of the original resolution.</p>

<p>4. But a <i>substitute</i> may be offered, which
may change entirely the meaning of the
resolution under debate.</p>

<p>5. The amendment must first be discussed
and acted on, and then the original resolution
as amended.</p>

<p class="cgap"><i>Speaking</i></p>

<p>1. Any member desiring to speak on a
question should rise in his place and address
the moderator, confine his remarks to the
question, and avoid all unkind and disrespectful
language.</p>

<p>2. A speaker using improper language,
introducing improper subjects, or otherwise
out of order, should be called to order by
the chairman, or any member, and must
either conform to the regulations of the
body, or take his seat.</p>

<p>3. A member while speaking can allow
others to ask questions, or make explanations;
but if he yields the floor to another,
he cannot claim it again as his right.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="p46">[p.&nbsp;46]</span>
4. If two members rise to speak at the
same time, preference is usually given
to the one farthest from the chair, or to
the one opposing the question under discussion.</p>

<p>5. The fact that a person has several
times arisen, and attempted to get the floor,
gives him no claim or right to be heard.
Nor does a call for the question deprive a
member of his right to speak.</p>

<p class="cgap"><i>Voting</i></p>

<p>1. A question is put to vote by the chairman
having first distinctly restated it, that
all may vote intelligently. First, the <i>affirmative,</i>
then the <i>negative</i> is called; each so
deliberately as to give all an opportunity
of voting. He then distinctly announces
whether the motion is <i>carried,</i> or <i>lost.</i></p>

<p>2. Voting is usually done by &ldquo;aye&rdquo; and
&ldquo;no,&rdquo; or by raising the hand. In a doubtful
case by standing and being counted. On
certain questions by ballot.</p>

<p>3. If the vote, as announced by the chairman,
is doubted, it is called again, usually
by standing to be counted.</p>

<p>4. All members should vote, unless for
reasons excused; or unless under discipline,
<span class="pagenum" id="p47">[p.&nbsp;47]</span>
in which case they should take no part in
the business.</p>

<p>5. The moderator does not usually vote,
except the question be taken by ballot; but
when the meeting is equally divided, he is
expected, but is not obligated to give the
casting vote.</p>

<p>6. When the vote is to be taken by ballot,
the chairman appoints <i>tellers,</i> to distribute,
collect, and count the ballots.</p>

<p class="cgap"><i>Committees</i></p>

<p>1. Committees are nominated by the
chairman, if so directed by the body, or by
any member; and the nomination is confirmed
by a vote of the body. More commonly
the body directs that all committees
shall be <i>appointed</i> by the chairman, in which
case no vote is needed to confirm.</p>

<p>2. Any matter of business, or subject
under debate, may be <i>referred</i> to a committee,
with or without instructions. The
committee make their <i>report,</i> which is the
result of their deliberations. The body then
takes action on the report, and on any
recommendations it may contain.</p>

<p>3. The report of a committee is <i>accepted</i>
by a vote, which acknowledges their services,
<span class="pagenum" id="p48">[p.&nbsp;48]</span>
and takes the report before the body
for its action. Afterward, any distinct
<i>recommendation</i> contained in the report
is acted on, and may be adopted or rejected.</p>

<p>4. Frequently, however, when the recommendations
of the committee are of a trifling
moment or likely to be generally acceptable,
the report is <i>accepted</i> and <i>adopted</i> by the
same vote.</p>

<p>5. A report may be <i>recommitted</i> to the
committee, with or without instructions; or
that committee discharged, and the matter
referred to a new one, for further consideration,
so as to present it in a form more
likely to meet the general concurrence of
the body.</p>

<p>6. A committee may be appointed <i>with
power</i> for a specific purpose. This gives
them power to dispose conclusively of the
matter, without further reference to the
body.</p>

<p>7. The first named in the appointment
of a committee is by courtesy considered
the <i>chairman.</i> But the committee has the
right to name its own chairman.</p>

<p>8. The member who moves the appointment
of a committee is usually, though not
necessarily, named its chairman.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="p49">[p.&nbsp;49]</span>
9. Committees of arrangement, or for
other protracted service, <i>report progress</i>
from time to time, and are continued until
their final report, or until their appointment
expires by limitation.</p>

<p>10. A committee is <i>discharged</i> by a vote,
when its business is done, and its report accepted.
But usually, in routine business, a
committee is considered discharged by the
acceptance of its report.</p>

<p class="cgap"><i>Standing Committee</i></p>

<p>A committee appointed to act for a given
period or during the recess of the body is
called a <i>standing committee.</i> It has charge
of a given department of business assigned
by the body, and acts either with power,
under instructions, or at discretion, as may
be ordered. A standing committee is substantially
a minor board, and has its own
chairman, secretary, records, and times of
meeting.</p>

<p class="cgap"><i>Appeal</i></p>

<p>The moderator announces all votes, and
decides all questions as to rules of proceeding,
and order of debate. But any member
who is dissatisfied with his decisions may
<span class="pagenum" id="p50">[p.&nbsp;50]</span>
<i>appeal</i> from them to the body. The moderator
then puts the question, <i>&ldquo;Shall the
decision of the chair be sustained?&rdquo;</i> The
vote of the body, whether negative or affirmative,
is final. The right of appeal is
undeniable, but should not be resorted to
on trivial occasions.</p>

<p class="cgap"><i>Previous Question</i></p>

<p>Debate may be cut short by a vote to
take the <i>previous question.</i> This means that
the original, or main, question under discussion
be immediately voted on, regardless of
amendments and secondary questions and
without further debate. Usually a <i>two-thirds</i>
vote is necessary to order the previous
question.</p>

<p>1. If the motion for the previous question
be <i>carried,</i> then the main question must
be immediately taken, without further debate.</p>

<p>2. If the motion for the previous question
be <i>lost,</i> the debate proceeds, as though
no such motion had been made.</p>

<p>3. If the motion for the previous question
be <i>lost,</i> it cannot be renewed with reference
to the same question, during the same
session.</p>

<p class="cgap"><span class="pagenum" id="p51">[p.&nbsp;51]</span><i>To Lay on the Table</i></p>

<p>Immediate and decisive action on any
question under discussion may be deferred,
by a vote to <i>lay on the table</i> the resolution
pending. This disposes of the whole subject
for the present, and ordinarily is in
effect a final dismissal of it. But any member
has the right subsequently to call it up;
and the body will decide by vote whether,
or not, it shall be taken from the table.</p>

<p>1. Sometimes, however, a resolution is
laid on the table for the present, or until a
specified time, to give place to other business.</p>

<p>2. A motion to lay on the table must
apply to a resolution, or other papers. An
abstract subject cannot be disposed of in
this way.</p>

<p class="cgap"><i>Postponement</i></p>

<p>A simple <i>postponement</i> is for a specified
time or purpose, the business to be resumed
when the time or purpose is reached. But
a question <i>indefinitely postponed</i> is considered
as finally dismissed.</p>

<p class="cgap"><i>Not Debatable</i></p>

<p>Certain motions, by established usage, are
<i>not debatable,</i> but when once before the
body, must be taken without discussion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="p52">[p.&nbsp;52]</span>
These are: The <i>previous question,</i> for <i>indefinite
postponement,</i> to <i>commit,</i> to <i>lay on
the table,</i> to <i>adjourn.</i></p>

<p>But when these motions are modified by
some condition of <i>time, place,</i> or <i>purpose,</i>
they become debatable, and subject to the
rules of other motions; but debatable only in
respect to the time, place, or purpose which
brings them within the province of debate.</p>

<p>A body is, however, competent, by a vote,
to allow debate on all motions.</p>

<p class="cgap"><i>To Reconsider</i></p>

<p>A motion to <i>reconsider</i> a motion previously
passed must be made by one who
voted <i>for</i> the motion when it passed.</p>

<p>If the body votes to reconsider, then the
motion or resolution being reconsidered,
stands before them as previous to its passage,
and may be discussed, adopted, or rejected.</p>

<p>A vote to reconsider should be taken at
the same session at which the vote reconsidered
was passed, and when there are as
many members present.</p>

<p class="cgap"><i>Be Discussed</i></p>

<p>If, when a question is introduced, any
member objects to its discussion, as foreign,
<span class="pagenum" id="p53">[p.&nbsp;53]</span>
profitless, or contentious, the moderator
should at once put the question, <i>&ldquo;Shall this
motion be discussed?&rdquo;</i> If this question be
decided in the negative, the subject must be
dismissed.</p>

<p class="cgap"><i>Order of the Day</i></p>

<p>The body may decide to take up some
definite business at a specified time. That
business therefore becomes the <i>order of the
day,</i> for that hour. When the time mentioned
arrives, the chairman calls the business,
or any member may demand it, with
or without a vote: and all pending questions
are postponed in consequence.</p>

<p class="cgap"><i>Point of Order</i></p>

<p>Any member who believes that a speaker
is out of order, or that discussion is proceeding
improperly, may at any time <i>rise to
a point of order.</i> He must distinctly state
his question or objection, which the moderator
will decide.</p>

<p class="cgap"><i>Privileges</i></p>

<p>Questions relating to the <i>rights</i> and <i>privileges</i>
of members are of primary importance,
<span class="pagenum" id="p54">[p.&nbsp;54]</span>
and, until disposed of, take precedence
of all other business, and supersede all other
motions, except that of adjournment.</p>

<p class="cgap"><i>Rule Suspended</i></p>

<p>A rule of order may be <i>suspended</i> by a
vote of the body, to allow the transaction
of business necessary, but which could not
otherwise be done without a violation of
such rule.</p>

<p class="cgap"><i>Filling Blanks</i></p>

<p>Where different members are suggested
for filling blanks, the <i>highest number, greatest
distance,</i> and <i>longest time</i> are usually
voted on first.</p>

<p class="cgap"><i>Adjournment</i></p>

<p>1. A simple motion <i>to adjourn</i> is always
in order, except while a member is speaking,
or when taking a vote. It takes precedence
of all other motions, and is not
debatable.</p>

<p>2, In some deliberative bodies, a motion
to adjourn is in order while a speaker has
the floor, or a vote is being taken, the business
to stand, on reassembling, precisely as
when adjournment took place.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="p55">[p.&nbsp;55]</span>
3. A body may adjourn to a specific time;
but if no time be mentioned, the fixed, or
usual time of meeting, is understood. If
there be no fixed, or usual time of meeting,
then an adjournment without date is equivalent
to a dissolution.</p>

<h3 class="tdc" id="ch8">CHAPTER VIII</h3>

<p class="tdc"><span class="smcap">christian doctrine</span></p>

<p>All evangelical churches profess to take
the Holy Scriptures as their only and sufficient
guide in matters of religious faith
and practice. Baptists, especially, claim to
have no authoritative creed except the New
Testament. It is common, however, for the
churches to have formulated statements of
what are understood to be the leading Christian
doctrines, printed and circulated among
their members. These are not uniform
among the churches, but are in substantial
agreement as to the doctrines taught. Indeed,
each church is at liberty to prepare its
own confession, or have none at all; no one
form being held as binding and obligatory
on the churches to adopt. Members, on
being received to fellowship, are not required
to subscribe or pledge conformity
to any creed-form, but are expected to yield
substantial agreement to that which the
church with which they unite has adopted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="p57">[p.&nbsp;57]</span>
There are two Confessions which have
gained more general acceptance than any
others, and are now being widely adopted
by the churches over the country. As to
substance of doctrine, they do not essentially
differ. That known as the New Hampshire
Confession is commonly used by the churches
North, East, and West; while that known
as the Philadelphia Confession, is very generally
in use in the South and Southwest.
The former is much more brief and for that
reason preferred by many. The other is
substantially the London Confession of
Faith, published by English Baptists in
1689. It is much more full in statement
than the other, and is higher in its tone as
to the doctrines of grace.</p>

<p>American Baptists are decidedly Calvinistic
as to substance of doctrine, but moderately
so, being midway between the extremes
of Arminianism and Antinomianism.
Though diversities of opinion may incline to
either extreme, the &ldquo;general atonement&rdquo;
view is for the most part held, while the
&ldquo;particular atonement&rdquo; theory is maintained
by not a few. The freedom of the human
will is declared, while the sovereignty of
Divine grace, and the absolute necessity of
the Spirit&rsquo;s work in faith and salvation are
<span class="pagenum" id="p58">[p.&nbsp;58]</span>
maintained. They practice &ldquo;strict communion,&rdquo;
as do their mission churches in
foreign lands. In Great Britain, Baptists
are sharply divided between &ldquo;strict and free
communion,&rdquo; and between the particular and
the general atonement theories.</p>

<p>The New Hampshire Confession, with a
few verbal changes, is here inserted. But
some of the proof-texts usually accompanying
these articles are, for want of space,
omitted.<a id="ch8_fna1"></a><a class="fnanchor" href="#ch8_fn1">[1]</a></p>

<p class="cgap">ARTICLES OF FAITH</p>

<p class="tdc"><span class="smcap">i. the scriptures</span></p>

<p class="cgap"><span class="smcap">ii. the true god</span></p>

<p>We believe the Scriptures teach that there
is one, and only one, living and true God,
an infinite, intelligent Spirit, whose name is
<span class="smcap">Jehovah,</span> the Maker and Supreme Ruler
of Heaven and <span class="wsnw">Earth:[1]</span> inexpressibly glorious
in <span class="wsnw">holiness,[2]</span> and worthy of all possible
honor, confidence, and <span class="wsnw">love;[3]</span> that in the
unity of the Godhead there are three Persons,
the Father, the Son, and the Holy
<span class="wsnw">Ghost;[4]</span> equal in every Divine perfection,
and executing distinct but harmonious offices
in the great work of redemption.</p>

<p class="bq">[1] John <span class="wsnw">4:24.</span> God is a spirit.
Ps. <span class="wsnw">147:5.</span> His understanding
is infinite. Ps. <span class="wsnw">83:18.</span> Thou whose name alone is <span class="smcap">Jehovah</span>
art the Most High over all the earth. Heb. <span class="wsnw">3:4;</span> Rom. <span class="wsnw">1:20;</span>

<p class="cgap"><span class="smcap">iii. the fall of man</span></p>

<p>We believe the Scriptures teach that man
was created in holiness, under the law of his
<span class="wsnw">Maker;[1]</span> but by voluntary transgression fell
from that holy and happy <span class="wsnw">state;[2]</span> in consequence
of which all mankind are now <span class="wsnw">sinners[3]</span>
not by constraint but choice; being
by nature utterly void of that holiness required
by the law of God, positively inclined
to evil; and therefore under just <span class="wsnw">condemnation,[4]</span>
without defense or <span class="wsnw">excuse.[5]</span></p>

<p class="bq">[1] Gen. <span class="wsnw">1:27.</span> God created man in His own image.
Gen. <span class="wsnw">1:31.</span>
And God saw everything that He had made, and behold, it was
very good. Eccl. <span class="wsnw">7:29;</span> Acts <span class="wsnw">17:26;</span>
Gen. <span class="wsnw">2:16.</span></p>

<p class="bq">[2] Gen. <span class="wnsw">3:6</span>&ndash;24. And when the woman saw that the tree was
good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree

<p class="bq">[3] Rom. <span class="wsnw">5:19.</span> By one man&rsquo;s disobedience many were made
sinners. John <span class="wsnw">3:6;</span> Ps. <span class="wsnw">51:5;</span>

<p class="bq">[4] Eph. <span class="wsnw">2:3.</span> Among whom also we all had our conversation in
times past in the lusts of our flesh fulfilling the desires of the

Rom. <span class="wsnw">1:20.</span> So that they are without excuse.
Rom. <span class="wsnw">3:19.</span> That every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become
guilty before God. Gal. <span class="wsnw">3:22.</span></p>

<p class="cgap"><span class="pagenum" id="p61">[p.&nbsp;61]</span>
<span class="smcap">iv. the way of salvation</span></p>

<p>We believe the Scriptures teach that the
salvation of sinners is wholly of <span class="wsnw">grace;[1]</span>
through the mediatorial offices of the Son
of <span class="wsnw">God;[2]</span> who according to the will of the
Father, became man, yet without <span class="wsnw">sin;[3]</span>
honored the Divine law by His personal
obedience, and by His death made a full
atonement for our <span class="wsnw">sins;[4]</span> that having risen
from the dead, He is now enthroned in
heaven; and uniting in His wonderful
person the tenderest sympathies with Divine
perfections, He is every way qualified to be
a suitable, a compassionate and all-sufficient
<span class="wsnw">Saviour.[5]</span></p>

<p class="bq">[1] Eph. <span class="wsnw">2:5.</span> By grace ye are saved.

<p class="bq">[2] John <span class="wsnw">3:16.</span> For God so loved the world that He gave His

perish, but have everlasting life.</p>

<p class="bq">[3] Phil. <span class="wsnw">2:6</span>&ndash;7. Who being in the form of God thought it
not robbery to be equal with God; but made Himself of no

<p class="bq">[4] Isa. <span class="wsnw">53:4,</span> 5. He was wounded for our transgressions, He
was bruised for our iniquities; the chastisement of our peace

uttermost that come unto God by Him, seeing He ever liveth to

all the fulness of the Godhead bodily.</p>

<p class="cgap"><span class="pagenum" id="p62">[p.&nbsp;62]</span>
<span class="smcap">v. justification</span></p>

<p>We believe the Scriptures teach that the
great Gospel blessing which <span class="wsnw">Christ[1]</span> secures
to such as believe in Him is <span class="wsnw">justification;[2]</span>
that justification includes the pardon of
<span class="wsnw">sin,[3]</span> and the gift of eternal life on principles
of righteousness; that it is bestowed, not in
consideration of any works of righteousness
which we have done, but solely through
faith in Christ; by means of which faith
His perfect righteousness is freely imputed
to us by <span class="wsnw">God;[4]</span> that it brings us into a
state of most blessed peace and favor with
God, and secures every other blessing needful
for time and <span class="wsnw">eternity.[5]</span></p>

<p class="bq">[1] John <span class="wsnw">1:16.</span> Of His fulness have all we received.
Eph. <span class="wsnw">3:8.</span></p>

<p class="bq">[2] Acts <span class="wsnw">13:39.</span> By Him all that believe are justified from all
things. Isa. <span class="wnsw">3:11,</span> 12; Rom. <span class="wsnw">5:1.</span></p>

<p class="bq">[3] Rom. <span class="wsnw">5:9.</span> Being justified by His blood, we shall be saved
from wrath through Him. Zech. <span class="wsnw">13:1;</span> Matt. <span class="wsnw">9:6;</span>
Acts <span class="wsnw">10:43.</span></p>

<p class="bq">[4] Rom. <span class="wsnw">5:19.</span> By the obedience of One shall many be made
righteous. Rom. <span class="wsnw">3:24</span>&ndash;26; <span class="wsnw">4:23</span>&ndash;25;

<p class="bq">[5] Rom. <span class="wsnw">5:1,</span> 2. Being justified by faith, we have peace with
God, through our Lord Jesus Christ: by whom also we have
access by faith into this grace wherein we stand and rejoice in
hope of the glory of God.</p>

<p class="cgap"><span class="smcap">vi. the freeness of salvation</span></p>

<p>We believe the Scriptures teach that the
blessings of salvation are made free to all
<span class="pagenum" id="p63">[p.&nbsp;63]</span>
by the <span class="wsnw">Gospel:[1]</span> that it is the immediate
duty of all to accept them by a cordial,
penitent, and obedient <span class="wsnw">faith;[2]</span> and that nothing
prevents the salvation of the greatest
sinner on earth but his own determined depravity
and voluntary rejection of the <span class="wsnw">Gospel;[3]</span>
which rejection involves him in an
aggravated <span class="wsnw">condemnation.[4]</span></p>

<p class="bq">[1] Isa. <span class="wsnw">55:1.</span> Ho, every one that thirsteth, come ye in the
waters. Rev. <span class="wsnw">22:17.</span> Whosoever will; let him take the water

Rom. <span class="wsnw">1:15</span>&ndash;17.</p>

<p class="bq">[3] John <span class="wsnw">5:40.</span> Ye will not come to Me, that ye might have

<p class="bq">[4] John <span class="wsnw">3:19.</span> And this is the condemnation, that light is

Luke <span class="wsnw">19:27;</span> 2&nbsp;Thess. <span class="wsnw">1:8.</span></p>

<p class="cgap"><span class="smcap">vii. regeneration</span></p>

<p>We believe the Scriptures teach that in
order to be saved, men must be regenerated,
or born <span class="wsnw">again;[1]</span> that regeneration consists
in giving a holy disposition to the <span class="wsnw">mind;[2]</span>
that it is effected in a manner above our
comprehension by the Holy Spirit, in connection
with Divine <span class="wsnw">truth,[3]</span> so as to secure
our voluntary obedience to the <span class="wsnw">Gospel;[4]</span>
and that its proper evidence appears in the
<span class="pagenum" id="p64">[p.&nbsp;64]</span>
holy fruits of repentance, faith, and newness
of <span class="wsnw">life.[5]</span></p>

<p class="bq">[1] John <span class="wsnw">3:3.</span> Verily, verily I say unto thee, except a man

Ezek. <span class="wsnw">36:26;</span> Deut. <span class="wsnw">30:6;</span>

<p class="bq">[3] John <span class="wsnw">3:8.</span> The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou
hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh,
and whither it goeth, so is every one that is born of the

<p class="bq">[4] 1&nbsp;Peter <span class="wsnw">1:22</span>&ndash;25. Ye have purified your souls in obeying
the truth through the Spirit. 1&nbsp;John <span class="wsnw">5:1;</span>

<p class="bq">[5] Eph. <span class="wsnw">5:9.</span> The fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness and

<p class="cgap"><span class="smcap">viii. repentance and faith</span></p>

<p>We believe the Scriptures teach that repentance
and faith are sacred duties, and
also inseparable graces, wrought in the soul
by the regenerating Spirit of <span class="wsnw">God;[1]</span> whereby
being deeply convinced of our guilt,
danger, and helplessness, and of the way of
salvation by <span class="wsnw">Christ,[2]</span> we turn to God with
unfeigned contrition, confession, and supplication
for mercy; at the same time heartily
receiving the Lord Jesus as our Prophet,
Priest, and King, and relying on Him alone
as the only and all-sufficient <span class="wsnw">Saviour.[3]</span></p>

<p class="bq"><span class="pagenum" id="p65">[p.&nbsp;65]</span>
[1] Mark <span class="wsnw">1:15.</span> Repent ye, and believe the Gospel. Acts <span class="wsnw">11:18.</span>

and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God. 1&nbsp;John <span class="wsnw">3:1.</span></p>

<p class="bq">[2] John <span class="wsnw">16:8.</span> He will reprove the world of sin, and of righteousness,
and of judgment. Acts <span class="wsnw">2:38.</span> Then Peter said unto
them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name
of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins. Acts <span class="wsnw">16:30,</span> 31.</p>

<p class="bq">[3] Romans <span class="wsnw">10:9</span>&ndash;11. If thou shalt confess with thy mouth
the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thy heart that God hath
raised Him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. Acts <span class="wsnw">3:22,</span> 23;
Heb. <span class="wsnw">4:14.</span></p>

<p class="cgap"><span class="smcap">ix. god&rsquo;s purpose of grace</span></p>

<p>We believe the Scriptures teach that election
is the eternal purpose of God, according
to which He graciously regenerates,
sanctifies, and saves <span class="wsnw">sinners;[1]</span> that being
perfectly consistent with the free agency of
man, it comprehends all the means in connection
with the <span class="wsnw">end;[2]</span> that it is a most
glorious display of God&rsquo;s sovereign <span class="wsnw">goodness;[3]</span>
that it utterly excludes boasting, and
promotes <span class="wsnw">humility;[4]</span> that it encourages the
use of means; that it may be ascertained
by its effects in all who truly accept of
<span class="wsnw">Christ;[5]</span> that it is the foundation of Christian
assurance; and that to ascertain it with
regard to ourselves demands and deserves
the utmost <span class="wsnw">diligence.[6]</span></p>

<p class="bq">[1] 2&nbsp;Tim. <span class="wsnw">1:8,</span> 9. But be thou partaker of the afflictions of the
Gospel, according to the power of God: who hath saved us and
<span class="pagenum" id="p66">[p.&nbsp;66]</span>
called us with an holy calling, not according to our works, but
according to his own purpose and grace which was given us in
Christ Jesus before the world began.</p>

<p class="bq">[2] 2&nbsp;Thess. <span class="wsnw">2:13,</span> 14. But we are bound to give thanks always
to God for you, brethren beloved of the Lord, because God
hath from the beginning chosen you to salvation, through
sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth; whereunto
He called you by our Gospel, to the obtaining of the glory of our
Lord Jesus Christ.</p>

<p class="bq">[3] 1&nbsp;Cor. <span class="wsnw">4:7.</span> For who maketh thee to differ from another?

<p class="bq">[4] 2&nbsp;Tim. <span class="wsnw">2:10.</span> Therefore I endure all things for the elect&rsquo;s

Heb. <span class="wsnw">6:11.</span></p>

<p class="cgap"><span class="smcap">x. sanctification</span></p>

<p>We believe the Scriptures teach that sanctification
is the process by which, according
to the will of God, we are made partakers
of His <span class="wsnw">holiness;[1]</span> that it is a progressive
<span class="wsnw">work;[2]</span> that it is begun in regeneration;
that it is carried on in the hearts of believers
by the presence and power of the Holy
Spirit, the Sealer and Comforter, in the continual
use of the appointed means&mdash;especially
the Word of God&mdash;self-examination,
self-denial, watchfulness and <span class="wsnw">prayer;[3]</span> and
<span class="pagenum" id="p67">[p.&nbsp;67]</span>
in the practice of all godly exercise and
<span class="wsnw">duties.[4]</span></p>

<p class="bq">[1] 1&nbsp;Thess. <span class="wsnw">4:3.</span>
For this is the will of God, even your sanctification.

<p class="bq">[2] Prov. <span class="wsnw">4:18.</span> The path of the just is as the shining light,
which shineth more and more, unto the perfect day.</p>

<p class="bq">[3] Phil. <span class="wsnw">2:12,</span> 13. Work out your own salvation with fear and

<p class="bq">[4] 1&nbsp;Tim. <span class="wsnw">4:7.</span> Exercise thyself unto godliness.</p>

<p class="cgap"><span class="smcap">xi. perseverance of saints</span></p>

<p>We believe the Scriptures teach that such
as are truly regenerate, being born of the
Spirit, will not utterly fall away and perish,
but will endure unto the <span class="wsnw">end;[1]</span> that their
preservering attachment from Christ is the
grand mark which distinguishes them from
superficial <span class="wsnw">professors;[2]</span> that a special Providence
watches over their <span class="wsnw">welfare;[3]</span> and that
they are kept by the power of God through
faith unto <span class="wsnw">salvation.[4]</span></p>

<p class="bq">[1] John <span class="wsnw">8:31.</span> Then said Jesus, If ye continue in My word,
then are ye My disciples indeed. 1&nbsp;John <span class="wsnw">2:27,</span> 28.</p>

<p class="bq">[2] 1&nbsp;John <span class="wsnw">2:19.</span> They went out from us, but they were not of

<p class="bq">[4] Phil. <span class="wsnw">1:6.</span> He who hath begun a good work in you will
perform it until the day of Jesus Christ. Phil. <span class="wsnw">2:12,</span> 13.</p>

<p class="cgap"><span class="smcap">xii. the law and gospel</span></p>

<p>We believe the Scriptures teach that the
law of God is the eternal and unchangeable
rule of his moral <span class="wsnw">government;[1]</span> that it is
holy, just, and <span class="wsnw">good;[2]</span> and that the inability
which the Scriptures ascribe to fallen men
to fulfill its precepts arises entirely from
their sinful <span class="wsnw">nature;[3]</span> to deliver them from
which, and to restore them through a Mediator
to unfeigned obedience to the holy law,
is one great end of the Gospel, and of the
means of grace connected with the establishment
of the visible <span class="wsnw">church.[4]</span></p>

<p class="bq">[1] Rom. <span class="wsnw">3:31.</span> Do we make void the law through faith? God
forbid. Yea, we establish the law. Matt. <span class="wsnw">5:17;</span>
Luke <span class="wsnw">16:17;</span> Rom. <span class="wsnw">3:20;</span> <span class="wsnw">4:15.</span></p>

<p class="bq">[2] Rom. <span class="wsnw">7:12.</span> The law is holy, and the commandment holy,
and just, and good. Rom. <span class="wnsw">7:7,</span> 14, 22; Gal. <span class="wsnw">3:21;</span>
Ps. 119.</p>

<p class="bq">[3] Rom. <span class="wsnw">8:7,</span> 8. The carnal mind is enmity against God: for
it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be. So
then they that are in the flesh cannot please God.</p>

<p class="bq">[4] Rom. <span class="wsnw">8:2</span>&ndash;4. For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ
Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death. For
what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the
flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh,
and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh; that the righteousness
of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh,
but after the Spirit.</p>

<p class="cgap"><span class="pagenum" id="p69">[p.&nbsp;69]</span>
<span class="smcap">xiii. a gospel church</span></p>

<p>We believe the Scriptures teach that a
visible Church of Christ is a company of
baptized <span class="wsnw">believers,[1]</span> associated by covenant
in the faith and fellowship of the <span class="wsnw">Gospel;[2]</span>
observing the ordinances of <span class="wnsw">Christ;[3]</span> governed
by His <span class="wsnw">laws;[4]</span> and exercising the gifts,
rights, and privileges invested in them by
His <span class="wsnw">Word;[5]</span> that its only Scriptural officers
are bishops or pastors, and <span class="wsnw">deacons,[6]</span>
whose qualifications, claims, and duties are
defined in the Epistles to Timothy and
Titus.</p>

<p class="bq">[1] Acts <span class="wsnw">2:41,</span> 42. Then they that gladly received his word
were baptized; and the same day there were added to them about
three thousand souls.</p>

<p class="bq">[2] 2&nbsp;Cor. <span class="wsnw">8:5.</span> They first gave their own selves to the Lord,

<p class="cgap"><span class="smcap">xiv. christian baptism</span></p>

<p>We believe the Scriptures teach that
Christian baptism is the immersion in water
<span class="pagenum" id="p70">[p.&nbsp;70]</span>
of a believer in <span class="wsnw">Christ,[1]</span> into the name of
the Father, and Son, and Holy <span class="wsnw">Ghost;[2]</span>
to show forth in a solemn and beautiful emblem
his faith in the crucified, buried, and
risen Saviour, with its effect, in His death to
sin and resurrection to a new <span class="wsnw">life;[3]</span> that it
is prerequisite to the privileges of a church
relation, and to the Lord&rsquo;s <span class="wsnw">Supper.[4]</span></p>

<p class="bq">[1] Acts <span class="wsnw">8:36</span>&ndash;39. And the eunuch said, See, here is water:

<p class="cgap"><span class="smcap">xv. the lord&rsquo;s supper</span></p>

partaken of by the members of the church
assembled for that <span class="wsnw">purpose,[1]</span> in commemoration
of the death of their <span class="wsnw">Lord,[2]</span> showing
<span class="pagenum" id="p71">[p.&nbsp;71]</span>
their faith and participation in the merits

for spiritual life and <span class="wsnw">nourishment,[3]</span> and their

<p>That we will exercise a Christian care

warn, exhort, and admonish each other
as occasion may require:</p>

<p>That we will not forsake the assembling
of ourselves together, but will uphold the
public worship of God and the ordinances
of His house:</p>

<p>That we will not omit closet and family
religion at home, nor neglect the great duty
of religiously training our children, and
those under our care, for the service of
Christ and the enjoyment of heaven:</p>

<p>That, as we are the light of the world,
and the salt of the earth, we will seek Divine
<span class="pagenum" id="p76">[p.&nbsp;76]</span>
aid to enable us to deny ungodliness and
every worldly lust, and to walk circumspectly
in the world, that we may win the
souls of men:</p>

<p>That we will cheerfully contribute of our
property according as God has prospered
us, for the maintenance of a faithful and
evangelical ministry among us, for the support
of the poor, and to spread the Gospel
over the earth.</p>

<p>That we will in all conditions, even till
death, strive to live to the glory of Him
who hath called us out of darkness into His
marvelous light.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And may the God of peace, who brought
again from the dead our Lord Jesus, that
great Shepherd of the sheep, through the
blood of the everlasting covenant, make us
perfect in every good work to do his will,
working in us that which is well pleasing
in his sight through Jesus Christ, to whom
be glory, for ever and ever. Amen.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 class="tdc" id="ch9">CHAPTER IX</h3>

<p class="tdc"><span class="smcap">optional standing resolutions</span></p>

<p>A Christian church should be the uncompromising
friend of all virtue, and the
determined enemy of all vice. Public
morality and social purity should find in it
an open and earnest advocate and defender.
Churches should bear in mind that Christian
morality, which constitutes their rule
of life, claims a much higher standard than
the morality of worldly society about them.
Therefore their deportment should be such
as to have a good report of them that are
without, and command the respect of the
world. In all this the pastor should be the
wise but decided and courageous teacher,
leader and exemplar for his people.</p>

<p>There are certain questions of moral
reform and social recreation with reference
to which the churches are often much perplexed,
but with reference to which they
should have settled convictions, and hold a
well-defined attitude. It is not wise to put
<span class="pagenum" id="p78">[p.&nbsp;78]</span>
definitions and restrictions touching intemperance,
card-playing, theater-going, dancing,
and the like, into covenants or articles
of faith. A better way is for the church,
after due consideration, to pass <i>standing
resolutions</i> on the subject, to be placed on
its records as a guide to future action.
Something like the following, to be varied
at the option of the body, would serve as a
declaration of principles:</p>

<p>1. <i>Resolved,</i> That this church expects
every member to contribute statedly for its
pecuniary support, according to his ability,
as God has prospered him, and that a refusal
to do this will be considered a breach
of covenant.</p>

<p>2. <i>Resolved,</i> That this church will entertain
and contribute statedly to Home and
Foreign Missions, and to other leading objects
of Christian benevolence, approved of
and supported by our denomination.</p>

<p>3. <i>Resolved,</i> That the religious education
of the young and Bible study as represented
in Sunday school work commend
themselves to our confidence, and we will,
to the extent of our ability, give them our
sympathy and our aid, by both our personal
cooperation and contributions and expressed
<span class="pagenum" id="p79">[p.&nbsp;79]</span>
appreciation of all their legitimate
aims and work.</p>

<p>4. <i>Resolved,</i> That in our opinion, the use
of intoxicating drinks as a beverage, and
also the manufacture and sale of the same
for such a purpose are contrary to Christian
morals, injurious to personal piety, and a
hindrance to Gospel truth, and that persons
so using, making, or selling, are thereby disqualified
for membership in this church.</p>

<p>5. <i>Resolved,</i> That we emphatically discountenance
and condemn the practice of
church-members frequenting theaters and
other similar places of public amusements,
as inconsistent with a Christian profession,
detrimental to personal piety, and pernicious
in the influence of its example on others.</p>

<p>6. <i>Revolved,</i> That the members of this
church are earnestly requested not to provide
for, take part in, or by any means encourage
dancing or card-playing; but in all
consistent ways to discountenance the same
as a hindrance to personal godliness in their
associations and tendencies, and an offense
to brethren whom we should not willingly
grieve.</p>

<h3 class="tdc" id="ch10">CHAPTER X</h3>

<p class="tdc"><span class="smcap">baptism considered</span></p>

<p>What is Christian baptism? This is
the gravest question which enters into the
baptismal controversy. Other questions of
moment there are in connection with it,
touching the design, the efficacy, and the
subjects. But it is of primary importance
to know what constitutes baptism.</p>

<p>Baptists answer the question by saying
that baptism is the immersion, dipping, or
burying in water, of a professed believer in
Christ, in the name of the Father, the Son,
and the Holy Spirit.</p>

<p>Pedobaptists, both Roman Catholic and
Protestant, answer the question by saying
that baptism is either the sprinkling or pouring
of water upon the candidate, touching
the forehead with wet fingers, or dipping
the person wholly into water; in either case
in the name of the Father, the Son, and
the Spirit; and that it may be administered
<span class="pagenum" id="p81">[p.&nbsp;81]</span>
to a candidate on his profession of faith, or
to an unconscious infant on the professed
faith of parents or sponsors. This would
make four kinds of baptism, and two
classes of subjects for its reception; and
would consist rather in the application of
water to the person, than putting the person
into water.</p>

<p>Baptists hold to a unity of the ordinance,
as well as to a oneness of the faith; insisting
that as there is but one Lord, and one
faith, so there is but one baptism. And the
dipping in water of a professed disciple of
Christ is that one baptism. Neither sprinkling
a person with water, nor pouring water
upon him can by any possibility be Christian
baptism. That this position is the true
one, we appeal to the New Testament, and
the best extant historical and philological
authorities to establish.</p>

<p>Let it be distinctly understood, however,
that all the eminent names and learned authorities
hereafter cited are Pedobaptists.
Baptist authorities are wholly omitted, not
because they are less accurate or less valuable,
but because we prefer to allow our
opponents in this controversy to bear witness
for us, rather than to testify in our own
behalf.</p>

<p class="cgap"><span class="pagenum" id="p82">[p.&nbsp;82]</span>
<span class="smcap">the meaning of the word</span></p>

<p>The word <i>baptize</i> is, properly speaking,
a Greek word (<span lang="grc-Latn">baptizo</span>), adapted to the English
language by a change in its termination.
This is the word always used by
Christ and His Apostles to express and define
the ordinance. What does that word mean
as originally used? For it is certain that
our Lord, in commanding a rite to be observed
by believers of all classes, in all
lands, and through all ages, would use a
word of positive and definite import, and
one whose meaning would admit of no
reasonable doubt. What do Greek scholars
say? How do the Greek lexicons define
the word?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Scapula</span> says: &ldquo;To <i>dip,</i> to immerse, as
we do anything for the purpose of dyeing it.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Schleusner</span> says: &ldquo;Properly it signifies
to <i>dip,</i> to immerse, to immerse in water.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Parkhurst</span> says: &ldquo;To dip, <i>immerse,</i> or
plunge in water.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Stevens</span> says: &ldquo;To merge, or <i>immerse,</i>
to submerge, or bury in water.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Donnegan</span> says: &ldquo;To <i>immerse</i> repeatedly
into liquid, to submerge, to soak thoroughly.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="p83">[p.&nbsp;83]</span>
<span class="smcap">Robinson</span> says: &ldquo;To <i>immerse,</i> to sink.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Liddell and Scott</span> say: &ldquo;To <i>dip</i> repeatedly.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grimm&rsquo;s Lexicon</span> <i>of the New Testament,</i>
which in Europe and America stands confessedly
at the head of Greek lexicography,
as translated and edited by Professor
Thayer, of Harvard University, thus defines
<span lang="grc-Latn">baptizo:</span> &ldquo;(1) To dip repeatedly, to immerse,
submerge. (2) To cleanse by dipping
or submerging. (3) To overwhelm.
In the New Testament it is used particularly
of the rite of sacred ablution; first instituted
by John the Baptist, afterward by Christ&rsquo;s
command received by Christians and adjusted
to the contents and nature of their
religion, viz., an <i>immersion</i> in water, performed
as a sign of the removal of sin, and
administered to those who, impelled by a
desire for salvation, sought admission to the
benefits of the Messiah&rsquo;s kingdom. With
<i>eis</i> to mark the element into which the
immersion is made; <i>en</i> with the dative or
the thing in which one is immersed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The noun <span lang="grc-Latn">baptisma,</span> the only other word
used in the New Testament to denote the
rite, <span class="smcap">Grimm-Thayer</span> thus define: &ldquo;A
word peculiar to the New Testament and
<span class="pagenum" id="p84">[p.&nbsp;84]</span>
ecclesiastical writers: used (1) of John&rsquo;s
baptism; (2) of Christian baptism. This,
according to the view of the Apostles, is a
rite of sacred <i>immersion</i> commanded by
Christ.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Add to those such authorities as Alstidius,
Passow, Sch&ouml;ttgen, Stockius, Stourdza,
Sophocles, Anthon, Rosenm&uuml;ller, Wetstein,
Leigh, Turretin, Beza, Calvin, Witsius,
Luther, Vossius, Campbell, and many
others who bear the same witness to the
proper meaning of the word <i>baptize.</i> If
at any time the word may have a secondary
meaning, it is strictly in accord with its
primary meaning&mdash;to dip, or immerse. For
both classic and sacred Greek the same
meaning holds.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Prof. Moses Stuart,</span> one of the ablest
scholars America has produced, declared:
&ldquo;<span lang="grc-Latn">Baptizo</span> means to dip, plunge, or <i>immerse</i>
into any liquid. All lexicographers and
critics of any note are agreed in this.&rdquo;
<i>Essay on Baptism, p. 51; Biblical Repository,
1833, p. 298.</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;All lexicographers and critics, of any

foremost scholars of the age, and he a Pedobaptist.
What a concession!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="p85">[p.&nbsp;85]</span>
The Greek language is rich in terms for
the expression of all positive ideas, and all
varying shades of thought. Why, then, did
our Lord in commanding, and His Apostles
in transmitting His command to posterity,
use <i>always</i> and <i>only</i> the one word <span lang="grc-Latn">baptizo,</span>
to describe the action, and that one word
<span lang="grc-Latn">baptisma,</span> to describe the ordinance to which
He intended all His followers to submit?
The word <span lang="grc-Latn">louo</span> means to <i>wash</i> the body, and
<span lang="grc-Latn">nipto</span> to wash parts of the body; but these
words are not used, because washing is not
what Christ meant. <span lang="grc-Latn">Rantizo</span> means to
<i>sprinkle,</i> and if sprinkling were baptism this
would have been the word above all others;
but it was never so used. <span lang="grc-Latn">Cheo</span> means to
<i>pour:</i> but pouring is not baptism, and so
this word was never used to describe the
ordinance. <span lang="grc-Latn">Katharizo</span> means to <i>purify,</i> but
it is not used for the ordinance. The facts
are clear and the reasoning conclusive.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Stourdza,</span> the Russian scholar and diplomat,
says: &ldquo;The church of the West has
then departed from the example of Jesus
Christ; she has obliterated the whole sublimity

is as if one should say <i>immersion</i> by

<p>The baptism of Jesus in the Jordan is
thus described: &ldquo;And Jesus, when He was
baptized, went up straightway out of the
water&rdquo; (Matt. <span class="wsnw">3:16).</span> And again, it is
recorded that Jesus &ldquo;was baptized of John
in Jordan: and straightway coming up out
of the water&rdquo; (Mark <span class="wsnw">1:10).</span> He certainly
would not go down into Jordan to have
water sprinkled on Him. Nobody believes
He would. He was baptized <i>in</i> Jordan, not
<i>with</i> Jordan. Moreover, he was <i>baptized,</i>
that is, <i>immersed,</i> not <i>rantized,</i> that is,
<i>sprinkled.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bishop Taylor</span> says: &ldquo;The custom of

<p>It is recorded that &ldquo;John also was baptizing

Why need much water except for dipping,
or burying candidates in the act of baptism?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John Calvin,</span> the great theologian,

down into the water, both, or either of them,
if not for an immersion?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Venema,</span> the ecclesiastical historian, says:
&ldquo;It is without controversy, that baptism in
the primitive church was administered by
<i>immersion</i> into water, and not by sprinkling;
seeing that John is said to have baptized

also going down into the water baptized the

we are <i>buried</i> with him, by baptism,
into death&rdquo; (Rom. <span class="wsnw">6:4).</span> To the Colossians,
in nearly the same language, &ldquo;<i>Buried</i>
with him in baptism&rdquo; (Col. <span class="wsnw">2:12).</span> No
one can misunderstand the meaning of these
words. Neither sprinkling, pouring, washing,
cleansing&mdash;nothing but a complete submersion&mdash;can
represent a burial. And no

<p><span class="smcap">Archbishop Tillotson</span> makes this comment:

<span class="smcap">as to the greek church</span></p>

<p>It is a notable fact and worthy of record
in this discussion, that the Greek Church
has always retained immersion in baptism.
This church extends over Greece, Russia,
Arabia, Palestine, Abyssinia, Siberia, and
other Oriental countries. Like the Latin
Church, it has corrupted the primitive purity
of Gospel doctrine and practice with many
absurd glosses and superstitious rites. It
practices infant baptism, yet it is by <i>dipping,</i>
even in the severe climate of Siberia;
and it uses <i>trine</i> immersion, or dipping the
candidate three times, one to each of the
names in the sacred Trinity. But in all its
branches immersion is retained.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Edinburgh Encyclopedia</span> says:
&ldquo;The Greek Church, as well as the Schismatics
in the East, retained the custom of
<i>immersing</i> the whole body; but the Western
Church adopted, in the <i>thirteenth century,</i>
the mode of sprinkling, which has been
continued by the Protestants, Baptists only
excepted.&rdquo; <i>Ency. Edin., Art. Baptism.</i></p>

<p class="cgap"><span class="smcap">the design of baptism</span></p>

<p>What was baptism intended to represent?
As a religious rite it meant something, had
some symbolic force, and represented some
moral or spiritual fact or truth. Its meaning
was clearly this: to show forth the
death, burial, and resurrection of Christ,
who died for our sins, and rose again for
our justification. And every believer who
receives this ordinance, professes thereby to
have faith in the merits of Christ&rsquo;s death
as the ground of his own hope of Salvation;
to have fellowship also with His sufferings,
and makes a declaration of his own death
to sin, and rising to a new life in Christ.
It also typifies the washing of regeneration;
it further declares the candidate&rsquo;s hope of a
resurrection from the dead, even as Christ,
into the likeness of whose death he is
buried, was raised up by the glory of the
Father. Chiefly <i>death, burial,</i> and <i>resurrection:</i>
the great facts of redemptive grace
are by it set forth. Immersion in baptism
does teach all this, and immersion alone can
teach it. Careful students of the New
<span class="pagenum" id="p102">[p.&nbsp;102]</span>
Testament have clearly seen this, and very
generally confessed it, whatever may have
been their practice.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bishop Newton</span> says: &ldquo;Baptism was
usually performed by <i>immersion,</i> or dipping
the whole body under water, to represent
the death, burial, and resurrection of Christ,
and thereby signify the person&rsquo;s own dying
to sin, the destruction of its power, and his
resurrection to a new life.&rdquo; <i>Pract. Expos.
Cate., p. 297.</i></p>

<p>Bloomfield, Barnes, Schaff, Poole, Hammond,
Barrows, Baxter, MacKnight, Olshausen,
Grotius, Saurin, Buddeus, Pictetus,
Frankius, Wall, Towerson, Adam Clark,
Tyndale, and others, bear similar testimony
as to the design of the ordinance, and how
it is answered in immersion only.</p>

<p class="cgap"><span class="smcap">a sufficiency of water</span></p>

<p>There have been found persons so ignorant,
or so weak, or so perverse in their
opposition to immersion, as to assert that
the Jordan was a small stream, so nearly
dry in the summer, that it had not sufficient
depth of water for the immersion of the
multitudes of the disciples of John and of
<span class="pagenum" id="p103">[p.&nbsp;103]</span>
Jesus said to have been baptized in it; and
also that Jerusalem had no sufficient accommodation
for the immersion of the thousands
of converts at the Pentecost, and on
subsequent occasions. People are becoming
more intelligent, and more candid, and it is
possible that such puerile objections are no
more heard. But it may be well to give
passing notice to the facts.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Edward Robinson,</span> at that time

<p class="cgap"><span class="smcap">the rise of sprinkling</span></p>

<p>The question will naturally arise and very
properly, When did sprinkling for baptism
first come into use? And how came it to
pass, that a human device superseded and
took the place of a Divine institution? These
questions are fully and satisfactorily answered
by Pedobaptist scholars themselves,
whose testimony we accept as a justification
of Baptist views.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="p105">[p.&nbsp;105]</span>
For <i>two hundred and fifty years</i> after
Christ we have no evidence of any departure
from the primitive practice of immersion.
At length the idea came to prevail
that baptism possessed saving virtue, and
had power to purify and sanctify the soul,
making its salvation more secure. It was
consequently thought unsafe to die unbaptized.
Here was the germ of the pernicious
dogma of &ldquo;baptismal regeneration,&rdquo; the
foundation alike of infant baptism and of
sprinkling instead of immersion.</p>

<p>The first authenticated instance of <i>sprinkling</i>
occurred about the middle of the third
century, or <span class="smcap">a.&nbsp;d.</span> 250. This was the case
of Novatian. The historian Eusebius gives
this case, and Doctor Wall in his laborious
researches could find no earlier instance;
good evidence that no earlier existed.
Novatian was dangerously sick, and believing
himself about to die, was anxious to be
baptized. The case seemed urgent, and as
he was thought to be too feeble to be
<i>immersed,</i> a substitute was resorted to;
water was poured profusely over him as he
lay in bed, so as to resemble as much as
possible a submersion. The word used to
describe this action (<span lang="la">perichutheis, purfusus</span>)
has usually been rendered <i>besprinkle;</i> it
<span class="pagenum" id="p106">[p.&nbsp;106]</span>
rather means to pour profusely over and
about one. This it was thought might answer
the purpose in such an emergency.</p>

<p>From this time onward pouring and sprinkling
were resorted to at times of extreme
illness, or feebleness, where persons could
not leave their beds, and hence was termed
<i>clinic</i> baptism, from <span lang="la">clina,</span> a couch. But it
was always regarded as a substitute for baptism,
rather than baptism itself; and its
validity was doubted. Novatian himself
having recovered from his sickness, was
objected to when his friends proposed to
make him bishop, because, it was said, he
had never been properly baptized. It was
not, however, until the seventeenth century
that sprinkling became common in Europe,
in France first, and then extending through
those countries over which the pope held
sway. At length, accepted by Calvin and
the Genevan Church, it extended into Scotland,
by John Knox, and other Scotch
refugees, who had found in Geneva a shelter
from the persecution to which they had
been exposed in their native country; then
into England: and in 1643 it was adopted
as the exclusive mode of baptism by a
majority of one of the Westminster Assembly
of Divines, and sanctioned by Parliament
<span class="pagenum" id="p107">[p.&nbsp;107]</span>
the next year. All of which is
verified by Eusebius, Valesius, Wall, Salmasius,
Venema, Taylor, Towerson, Grotius,
&ldquo;Ency. Brit.,&rdquo; &ldquo;Edin. Ency.,&rdquo; and other
reliable historical

<p class="tdc"><span class="smcap">the lord&rsquo;s supper</span></p>

<p>The Lord&rsquo;s Supper, called also the
&ldquo;Eucharist,&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Communion,&rdquo; is
the most sacred act of Christian worship,
and the highest expression of the mysteries
of our holy religion. It is a service in
which bread and wine&mdash;the <i>loaf</i> and the <i>cup</i>&mdash;are
used to represent the body and the
blood of Christ, the Lamb of God, slain for
us. The bread is <i>broken,</i> distributed, and
eaten; the wine is <i>poured,</i> distributed, and
drunk by the members of the assembled
church, to show the sacrifice of Christ, His
body broken, and His blood shed for their
redemption; and that by His death they
have life. Being begotten of God through
the operation of the Spirit, their new life is
sustained and nourished by mystically feeding
on Him who is the Bread of God, which
came down from heaven to give life to the
world. He said: &ldquo;This do in remembrance
of Me.&rdquo; &ldquo;As oft as ye eat this bread
<span class="pagenum" id="p109">[p.&nbsp;109]</span>
and drink this cup, ye proclaim the Lord&rsquo;s
death, till He come.&rdquo; &ldquo;Except ye eat the
flesh of the Son of man, and drink His blood,
ye have no life in you.&rdquo; &ldquo;Whoso eateth
My flesh and drinketh My blood hath
eternal life.&rdquo; &ldquo;He that eateth My flesh,
and drinketh My blood, dwelleth in Me,
and I in him.&rdquo; It is a Divine reality, though
a sublime mystery.</p>

<p class="cgap"><span class="smcap">open and close communion</span></p>

<p>The controversy between Baptists and
other denominations, so far as the Lord&rsquo;s
Supper is concerned, has no reference to its
nature, the purpose for which it was instituted,
the manner of its administration, or
the effect of the elements on the participants.
It has reference simply to the proper <i>subjects</i>
for participation in the privilege.
Who may, and who may not properly and
of right come to the Lord&rsquo;s Table? On
the question of what are the Scriptural
qualifications of participants, Baptist and
Pedobaptists differ&mdash;differ not as to the
general rule to be applied, but as to its particular
application. And this particular
application leads to the controversy on
what is called <i>&ldquo;close communion,&rdquo;</i> as practiced
<span class="pagenum" id="p110">[p.&nbsp;110]</span>
by Baptists, and to what is called
<i>&ldquo;open communion,&rdquo;</i> as practiced by Pedobaptists.</p>

<p><i>What is open communion? Open,</i> free
or mixed communion is, strictly speaking,
that which allows any one who desires, and
believes himself qualified, to come to the
Lord&rsquo;s Table, without any questions being
asked, or conditions imposed by the church
in which the ordinance is observed. But
ordinarily the term is applied to the practice
of the greater part of the Pedobaptist
churches, which hold that <i>sprinkling</i>
is lawful baptism, and invite, not all
persons, but members of all evangelical
churches, whatever be their view of
church order and ordinances; holding
them all as being baptized because they
have been sprinkled.</p>

<p><i>What is close communion? Close,</i> strict,
or restricted communion is, properly speaking,
that which does not invite all indiscriminately
to the Lord&rsquo;s Table, but restricts
the privilege to a particular class.
But ordinarily the term is applied to the
practice of Baptist churches, which invite
only baptized believers, walking in orderly
fellowship in their own churches. And by
baptized believers, they mean, of course,
<span class="pagenum" id="p111">[p.&nbsp;111]</span>
immersed believers; not admitting sprinkling
to be baptism at all.</p>

<p class="cgap"><span class="smcap">one and the same rule</span></p>

<p><i>Observe further:</i> That Baptists and Pedobaptists
have one and the same rule in
theory as to the proper qualification for
participants, namely, they all hold that
baptism is a prerequisite. That unbaptized
persons have no legal right to the Lord&rsquo;s
Supper, and cannot consistently be invited
to it. Pedobaptists would not invite unbaptized
persons to the Lord&rsquo;s Table, however
good Christians, since such could not
become church-members, and the Supper is
for those within the church, not for the
outside world. For though there are a few
churches and a few pastors, who in their
extreme liberality might be disposed to invite
everybody to the sacred ordinance yet
such a course would be contrary to their
denominational standards, and opposed to
the usages of their churches generally.</p>

<p><i>Further observe:</i> They all practice a restriction
since they restrict the privilege
to a particular class: namely, baptized believers,
walking in orderly church fellowship.
But Baptists and Pedobaptists differ
<span class="pagenum" id="p112">[p.&nbsp;112]</span>
as to what constitutes <i>baptism,</i> the one rejecting,
and the other accepting the validity
of sprinkling. Thus Baptists&rsquo; custom
is more <i>&ldquo;close,&rdquo;</i> and Pedobaptists&rsquo; is more
<i>&ldquo;open,&rdquo;</i> by the difference between their
views of baptism; and by that difference
only. <i>Therefore,</i> it is manifest that the
question so called of &ldquo;close&rdquo; and &ldquo;open&rdquo;
communion is really not a question of
&ldquo;communion&rdquo; at all, but of what constitutes
Scriptural baptism. Let that be settled,
and the controversy as to the restriction
of the Lord&rsquo;s Supper will cease.</p>

<p class="cgap"><span class="smcap">the baptist position</span></p>

<p>Baptists hold that there are <i>three</i> imperative
conditions precedent to the privileges
of the Lord&rsquo;s Supper: 1.&nbsp;<i>Regeneration.</i>
No unconverted person can with propriety,
or of right, eat and drink at that
sacred feast, in commemoration of Christ&rsquo;s
death. They must be persons dead to sin,
and alive to God; born again, through the
operation of the Spirit. 2.&nbsp;<i>Baptism.</i> Buried
with Christ in baptism on a profession
of faith in Him. No person, however good,
and however manifestly regenerate, is prepared
without baptism, according to the
<span class="pagenum" id="p113">[p.&nbsp;113]</span>
Divine order, to receive the Supper. Without
baptism he cannot enter the fellowship
of the church, where the Supper alone is
to be enjoyed. 3.&nbsp;<i>An orderly walk is necessary.</i>
An upright and consistent Christian
walk, and godly conversation among the
saints, and before the world. For though
one may be truly regenerate, and properly
baptized, yet if he be a disorderly walker,
violating his covenant obligations, living in
sin, and bringing reproach on the Christian
profession, he has no right to sit at the
Lord&rsquo;s Table.</p>

<p>The ordinances are a sacred trust which
Christ has committed to the churches as
custodians, and which they are to watch
and guard from all profane intrusion, and
improper use, with the most sedulous
fidelity. Baptists believe that in order to
maintain the purity and spirituality of the
churches, it is necessary to maintain the
ordinances pure; and especially necessary
to restrict the Supper to regenerate and
godly persons, baptized on a profession of
their faith, into the fellowship of the saints.
To adopt any other rule, or to allow any
larger liberty, would break down the distinction
between the church and the world;
would bring in a carnal and unconverted
<span class="pagenum" id="p114">[p.&nbsp;114]</span>
membership, and transfer the sacred mysteries
of the body and the blood of Christ
from the temple of God to the temple
of Belial. This would be disloyalty to
Christ.</p>

<p>The Apostolic plan was as follows: Those
who <i>believed</i> and <i>gladly received the Word,</i>
were <i>baptized.</i> Then they were <i>added to
the church.</i> Then they continued steadfastly
in the <i>Apostles&rsquo; doctrine,</i> and fellowship, and
in <i>breaking of bread,</i> and in <i>prayer.</i></p>

<p><i>Notice,</i> they were not baptized till they
had received the Word and believed. They
were not added to the church till they had
believed and been baptized. They did not
engage in the breaking of bread (that is,
the Supper,) till they had believed, been baptized,
and were added to the church. This
is the Divine order; and this is the order
which Baptists maintain and defend.</p>

<p class="cgap"><span class="smcap">pedobaptist close communion</span></p>

<p>It has already been shown that Pedobaptists
themselves practice a restricted or close
communion, limiting the privilege to baptized
(as they call them) members of evangelical
churches, and that their communion
is more liberal than that of the Baptists
<span class="pagenum" id="p115">[p.&nbsp;115]</span>
only, and only by so much as their baptism
(so-called) is more liberal than that of
Baptists.</p>

<p>But in some respects Pedobaptists practice
a &ldquo;close communion,&rdquo; restrictive in its conditions,
far beyond anything known to Baptists
whose illiberality they are accustomed
to magnify. They exclude a large class of
their own members from the Lord&rsquo;s Table&mdash;namely,
<i>baptized children!</i> Baptists do not
deny the Lord&rsquo;s Supper to their own members
in good standing. If children are suitable
subjects for baptism, it seems most
unreasonable and unjust to deny them the
Supper. If they can be benefited by one ordinance,
can they not be equally benefited by
the other? If they can receive the one on
the faith of sponsors, can they not receive the
other in the same way? Who has authorized
parents or ministers to give baptism to
unconverted and unconscious children, and
refuse them the Lord&rsquo;s Supper? By denying
the Supper to baptized children, Pedobaptists
act contrary to the traditions of the
ancient churches, which they are accustomed
to cite with so much assurance, in defense of
infant baptism. Do they not know that
those ancient churches (not the primitive
churches) gave the Lord&rsquo;s Supper to infants
<span class="pagenum" id="p116">[p.&nbsp;116]</span>
for many centuries? And the Greek
Church, through all its branches, continues
still the same practice.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doctor Coleman</span> says: &ldquo;After the general
introduction of infant baptism, in the
<i>second and third centuries,</i> the sacrament
continued to be administered to all who had
been baptized, whether infants or adults.
The reason alleged by Cyprian and others for
this practice was, that age was no impediment.
Augustine strongly advocates the
practice. The custom continued for several
centuries. It is mentioned in the third
Council of Tours, <span class="smcap">a.&nbsp;d.</span> 813; and even the
Council of Trent, <span class="smcap">a.&nbsp;d.</span> 1545, only decreed
that it should not be considered essential to
salvation. It is still scrupulously observed
by the Greek Church.&rdquo; <i>Anc. Christ. Exemp.,
Ch. 22, Sec. 8; Bing., Orig., B. 15, Ch. 4,
Sec. 7. Many other writers bear the same
testimony.</i></p>

<p class="cgap"><span class="smcap">the power of sympathy</span></p>

<p>There is a small class of Baptists who are
at times inclined to desire, and it may be, to
seek a wider liberty at the Lord&rsquo;s Table
than they find accorded in their own
churches. The one prevailing argument
with them is <i>sympathy.</i> To them it seems
<span class="pagenum" id="p117">[p.&nbsp;117]</span>
kindly and fraternal to invite all who say
they love our common Lord and Saviour to
unite in commemorating His death in the
Supper. Even if they have not been baptized,
they themselves believe they have, and they
are good Christian people. &ldquo;Why stand
upon a technicality?&rdquo; they say. To such
the service is merely a sentimental service;
a kind of love feast to show Christian fellowship,
rather than an instituted commemoration
of their dying Lord. They
have neither Scripture, logic, expediency,
the scholarship, nor the concurrent practice
of Christendom, either past or present, to
sustain their position. But <i>sympathy</i> influences
them; yet sympathy should not control
conduct in matters of faith, or in acts
of conscience. It is a grave perversion
when affection for his disciples sways us
more than fidelity to our Lord. We should
not be so kind to <i>them</i> as to be untrue to
<i>Him.</i> Sincere Christians will honor those
who are loyal to Christ, even though they
differ in opinion.</p>

<p class="cgap"><span class="smcap">three facts explained</span></p>

<p>Baptists give the following reasons in justification
of their course in the following cases:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="p118">[p.&nbsp;118]</span>
1. They do not invite Pedobaptists to the
Lord&rsquo;s Supper with them, because such persons
are not baptized, as has been shown,
they being simply sprinkled. They may
be true converts, and have the spiritual
qualifications, but they are destitute of the
ceremonial qualification&mdash;baptism. The
&ldquo;buried in baptism&rdquo; comes before the
&ldquo;breaking of bread.&rdquo;</p>

<p>2. They do not accept the invitation of
Pedobaptist churches to eat at the Lord&rsquo;s
Table with them, for the same reason; they
are not baptized Christians. And while
the appreciate their Christian fellowship,
they could not accept their church fellowship,
and sit at the Lord&rsquo;s Table with them,
without accepting their sprinkling and indorsing
their baptismal errors.</p>

<p>3. They do not invite immersed members
of Pedobaptist churches to the Lord&rsquo;s Supper
with them, because such persons, though
they may be truly regenerate and properly
baptized, are walking disorderly by remaining
in and giving countenance to churches
which hold and practice serious errors as to
both the ordinances. These churches use
sprinkling for baptism and administer the
ordinance to infants, both of which are unscriptural.
And yet such persons, by remaining
<span class="pagenum" id="p119">[p.&nbsp;119]</span>
in them, encourage and support
these errors, instead of protesting against
them by leaving them. They insist on immersion
for themselves, and yet by a strange
inconsistency give their fellowship and influence
to perpetuate and sanction sprinkling
for others. This is inconsistent and disorderly
Christian walking; and, therefore, very
properly, Baptists decline to invite them to
the Lord&rsquo;s Supper.</p>

<p class="cgap"><span class="smcap">pedobaptist witnesses</span></p>

<p>In further proof that the position of
Baptists as to the Lord&rsquo;s Supper is correct and
Scriptural; that the difficulty lies with
baptism, and not with the Supper; and that
they must still continue to restrict the ordinance
to baptized believers, or else admit
that sprinkling is baptism, we cite the
concessions of distinguished Pedobaptist
scholars and Divines in evidence on our
side.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Justin Martyr,</span> one of the early Christian
Fathers, says of the Supper: &ldquo;This
food is called by us the Eucharist, of which
it is not lawful for any one to partake but
such as believe the things taught by us
to be true, and have been baptized.&rdquo; <i>Apol.</i>

&ldquo;Neither those doing penance, nor those not
yet baptized, were allowed to be present at
the celebration of this ordinance.&rdquo; <i>Eccl.

<p><span class="smcap">Neander,</span> the great church historian,
says: &ldquo;At this celebration, as may be easily
concluded, no one could be present who
was not a member of the Christian Church,
and incorporated into it by the rite of baptism.&rdquo;
<i>Ch. Hist., Vol. 1., 327. Boston,
1849.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cave,</span> one of the ablest writers on Christian
antiquities, says the participants in the
primitive church were those &ldquo;that had embraced
the doctrine of the Gospel, and had
been baptized into the faith of Christ. For,
looking upon the Lord&rsquo;s Supper as the highest
and most solemn act of religion, they
thought they could never take care enough
in the dispensing of it.&rdquo; <i>Prim. Christ., Part
I., Ch. 11, p. 333.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bingham,</span> in his able work on the Antiquities
of the Christian Church, says of the
early Christians: &ldquo;As soon as a man was
<span class="pagenum" id="p121">[p.&nbsp;121]</span>
baptized he was communicated&rdquo;&mdash;that is,
admitted to the communion. Baptism,
therefore, essentially preceded the Supper.&mdash;<i>Christ.
Antiq., B. 12, Ch. 4, Sec. 9, B. 15,
Ch. 3.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doctor Wall,</span> who searched the records
of antiquity for facts illustrating the history
of the ordinances, says: &ldquo;No church ever
gave the communion to any persons before
they were baptized. Among all the absurdities
that were ever held, none ever
maintained that any person should partake
of the communion before he was baptized.&rdquo;
<i>Hist. Inf. Bap., Part II., Ch. 9.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doctor Coleman</span> says of the early
churches: &ldquo;None indeed but believers in
full communion with the church were permitted
to be present.&rdquo; &ldquo;But agreeably to all
the laws and customs of the church, baptism
constituted membership with the
church. All baptized persons were legitimately
numbered among the communicants
as members of the church.&rdquo; <i>Anc. Christ.
Exemp., Ch. 21, Sec. 8.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doctor Schaff</span> says: &ldquo;The communion
was a regular part, and, in fact, the most
important and solemn part of the Sunday
worship,&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. in which none but full members

of the church could engage.&rdquo; <i>Ch. Hist.,

<p><span class="smcap">Doctor Doddridge</span> says: &ldquo;It is certain that

reaches, no unbaptized person received the
Lord&rsquo;s Supper.&rdquo; <i>Lectures, pp. 511, 512.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doctor Dick</span> says: &ldquo;An uncircumcised
man was not permitted to eat the Passover;
and an unbaptized man should not be permitted

<p><span class="smcap">Doctor Baxter</span> says: &ldquo;What man dares

without baptism do so.&rdquo; <i>Plain Scripture
Proof, p. 24.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doctor Dwight,</span> President of Yale College,
and author of &ldquo;Systematic Theology,&rdquo;
says: &ldquo;It is an indispensable qualification for
this ordinance that the candidate for communion
be a member of the visible church in
full standing. By this, I intend that he
should be a man of piety; that he should
have made a public profession of religion,
and that he should have been baptized.&rdquo;

<p><span class="pagenum" id="p123">[p.&nbsp;123]</span>
<span class="smcap">Doctor Griffin,</span> one of the fathers of
New England Congregationalism, says: &ldquo;I
agree with the advocates of close communion
on two points: 1.&nbsp;That baptism is the initiatory
ordinance which introduces us into the
visible church; of course, where there is no
baptism, there are no visible churches.
2.&nbsp;That we ought not to commune with those
who are not baptized, and of course not
church-members, even if we regard them as
Christians.&rdquo; <i>Letter on Baptism, 1829, cited
by Curtis on Com., p. 125.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doctor Hibbard,</span> a leading Methodist
scholar and Divine, says: &ldquo;In one principle
Baptist and Pedobaptist churches agree.
They both agree in rejecting from communion
at the table of the Lord, and in denying
the rights of church fellowship to all who
have not been baptized.&rdquo; And with admirable
frankness, he adds: &ldquo;The charge of
<i>close communion</i> is no more applicable to
the Baptist than to us [Pedobaptists]; insomuch
as the question of church fellowship
with them is determined by as liberal principles
as it is with any other Protestant
churches, so far, I mean, as the present subject
is concerned&mdash;i.e., <i>it is determined by
valid baptism.</i>&rdquo; <i>Hibbard on Christ. Bap.,

<p><span class="pagenum" id="p124">[p.&nbsp;124]</span>
<span class="smcap">Doctor Bullock,</span> another Methodist Divine,
says: &ldquo;Close communion, as it is generally
termed, is the only logical and consistent
course for Baptist churches to pursue.
If their premises are right, their conclusion
is surely just as it should be.&rdquo; And he commends
the firmness of Baptists in not inviting
to the communion those whom they
regard as unbaptized. He says: &ldquo;They do
not feel willing to countenance such laxity
in Christian discipline. Let us honor
them for their steadfastness in maintaining
what they believe to be a Bible precept,
rather than criticize and censure because
they differ with us concerning the intent
and mode of Christian baptism, and believe
it to be an irrepealable condition of coming
to the Lord&rsquo;s Table.&rdquo; <i>What Christians
Believe.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Independent,</span> one of the most
widely circulated, and perhaps the most influential
Pedobaptist paper in the country, in
an editorial, says: &ldquo;Leading writers of all
denominations declare that converts must be
baptized before they can be invited to the
communion table. This is the position
generally taken. But Baptists regarding
sprinkling as a nullity&mdash;no baptism at all&mdash;look
upon Presbyterians, Methodists, and
<span class="pagenum" id="p125">[p.&nbsp;125]</span>
others, as unbaptized persons.&rdquo; &ldquo;The
other churches cannot urge the Baptists to
become open communionists till they themselves
take the position that all who love
our Lord Jesus Christ, the unbaptized as
well as the baptized, may be invited to
the communion table.&rdquo; <i>Editorial, July,
1879.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Congregationalist,</span> the organ of
the New England Congregational Churches,
in an editorial, says: &ldquo;Congregationalists
have uniformly, until here and there an exception
has arisen of late years, required
baptism and church-membership as the prerequisite
of a seat at the table of the Lord.
It is a part of the false &lsquo;liberality&rsquo; which
now prevails in certain quarters, to welcome
everybody &lsquo;who thinks he loves Christ&rsquo; to
commune in His body and blood. Such a
course is the first step in breaking down
that distinction between the church and the
world, which our Saviour emphasized; and
it seems to us it is an unwise and mistaken
act for which no Scriptural warrant exists.&rdquo;
<i>Editorial, July 9, 1879.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Observer,</span> of New York, the oldest
and leading Presbyterian journal of this
country, said: &ldquo;It is not a want of charity
<span class="pagenum" id="p126">[p.&nbsp;126]</span>
which compels the Baptist to restrict his
invitation. He has no hesitation in admitting
the personal piety of his unimmersed
brethren. Presbyterians do not invite the
unbaptized, however pious they may be. It
is not uncharitable. It is not bigotry on
the part of Baptists to confine their communion
to those whom they consider the
baptized.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Interior,</span> of Chicago, the organ of
Western Presbyterians, said: &ldquo;The difference
between our Baptist brethren and ourselves
is an important difference. We agree
with them, however, in saying that unbaptized
persons should not partake of the
Lord&rsquo;s Supper. Their view compels them
to think that we are not baptized, and shuts
them up to close communion. Close communion
is, in our judgment, a more defensible
position than open communion, which is
justified on the ground that baptism is not
a prerequisite to the Lord&rsquo;s Supper. To
charge Baptists with bigotry because they
abide by the logical consequences of their
system is absurd.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Christian Advocate,</span> of New York,
the leading journal of American Methodists,
said: &ldquo;The regular Baptist churches in the
<span class="pagenum" id="p127">[p.&nbsp;127]</span>
United States may be considered today as
particularly a unit on <i>three points</i>&mdash;the non-use
of infant baptism, the immersion of
believers only upon a profession of faith,
and the administration of the holy communion
to such only as have been immersed
by ministers holding these views. In our
opinion the Baptist Church owes its amazing
prosperity largely to its adherence to these
views. In doctrine and government, and
in other respects, it is the same as Congregationalists.
In numbers, the regular
Baptists are more than six times as great as
the Congregationalists. It is not bigotry
to adhere to one&rsquo;s convictions, provided
the spirit of Christian love prevails.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Episcopal Recorder</span> said: &ldquo;The
close communion of the Baptist churches is
but the necessary sequence of the fundamental
idea out of which their existence
has grown. No Christian Church would
willingly receive to its communion even the
humblest and truest believer in Christ who
had not been baptized. With Baptists, immersion
only is baptism, and they therefore
of necessity exclude from the Lord&rsquo;s Table
all who have not been immersed. It is an
essential part of the system&mdash;the legitimate
carrying out of the creed.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="p128">[p.&nbsp;128]</span>
<span class="smcap">Bishop Coxe,</span> of the Episcopal diocese of
Western New York, says: &ldquo;The Baptists
hold that we have never been baptized, and
they must exclude us from their communion
table, if we were disposed to go there. Are
we offended? Do we call it illiberal? No;
we call it <i>principle,</i> and we respect it. To
say that we have never become members of
Christ by baptism seems severe, but it is a
conscientious adherence to duty, as they regard
it. I should be the bigot, and not
they, if I should ask them to violate their
discipline in this, or in any other particular.&rdquo;

<h3 class="tdc" id="ch12">CHAPTER XII</h3>

<p class="tdc"><span class="smcap">infant baptism</span></p>

<p>One of the customs held and upheld by
Pedobaptist churches, which Baptists seriously
condemn, is infant baptism. It is
practiced by both Roman Catholics and
Protestants as a religious institution; and
though not held as sacredly, or practiced as
widely as formerly, it still prevails to a
wide extent throughout the Christian world.
And yet it was not instituted by Christ, nor
practiced by His Apostles, nor known in the
primitive churches, and has neither sanction
nor recognition in the Word of God. It is
for this reason that Baptists utterly reject
and condemn the custom, as not simply useless
and without authority, but as a most
pernicious and hurtful usage; that it is injurious
both to the child that receives it,
and to the church which allows it, can be
easily shown. Baptism before faith, and
without a profession it, contradicts and
<span class="pagenum" id="p130">[p.&nbsp;130]</span>
does violence to all New Testament teaching.</p>

<p class="cgap"><span class="smcap">not of scriptural authority</span></p>

<p>Now, that infant baptism is not of Scriptural
authority, and was not known in the
first Christian ages, nearly all its advocates
and defenders have with considerable candor
admitted. Only a few of their historians
and scholars can be cited here.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. William Wall,</span> a learned Divine
of the English Church, who wrote the &ldquo;History
of Infant Baptism,&rdquo; a work so able
that the clergy in convocation assembled
gave him a vote of thanks for his defense
of the custom, says: &ldquo;Among all the persons
that are recorded as baptized by the
Apostles, there is no express mention of
any infants.&rdquo; <i>Hist. Inf. Bap., Intro., pp.
1, 55.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thomas Fuller,</span> the historian, says:
&ldquo;We do freely confess there is neither express
precept nor precedent in the New
Testament for the Baptism of Infants.&rdquo;
<i>Infants&rsquo; Advoc., pp. 71, 150.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Luther</span> says: &ldquo;It cannot be proved by
the sacred Scriptures that infant baptism
was instituted by Christ, or begun by the
<span class="pagenum" id="p131">[p.&nbsp;131]</span>
first Christians after the Apostles.&rdquo; <i>Vanity
of Inf. Bap., Part II., p. 8.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Neander</span> says: &ldquo;Baptism was administered
at first only to adults, as men were
accustomed to conceive of <i>baptism</i> and <i>faith</i>
as strictly connected. We have all reason
for not deriving infant baptism from Apostolic
institution.&rdquo; <i>Ch. Hist., Vol. I., p. 311;
Plant. and Train., Vol. I., p. 222.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Professor Lange</span> says: &ldquo;All attempts to
make out infant baptism from the New Testament
fail. It is totally opposed to the
spirit of the Apostolic age, and to the fundamental
principles of the New Testament.&rdquo;
<i>Inf. Baptism, p. 101.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Professor Jacobi</span> says: &ldquo;Infant baptism
was established neither by Christ, nor by
the Apostles.&rdquo; <i>Art. Bap., Kitto&rsquo;s Cycl. Bib.
Lit.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doctor Hanna</span> says: &ldquo;Scripture knows
nothing of the baptism of infants.&rdquo; <i>North
Brit. Review, Aug., 1852.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Professor Hagenbach</span> says: &ldquo;The passages
from Scripture cited in favor of infant
baptism as a usage of the primitive
church are doubtful and prove nothing.&rdquo;
<i>Hist. Dict., pp. 190, 193.</i></p>

<p>Bishop Burnett, Baxter, Goodwin,
<span class="pagenum" id="p132">[p.&nbsp;132]</span>
Limborch, Celarius, Field, and many others
bear similar testimony.</p>

<p class="cgap"><span class="smcap">when did it rise?</span></p>

<p>Since the New Testament knows nothing
of infant baptism, and since it was neither
instituted by Christ, nor practiced by His
Apostles, what was its origin, and when did
it come into use?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tertullian</span> is the first who mentions
the custom, and he opposes it. This was at
the close of the second century, or about
<span class="smcap">a.&nbsp;d.</span> 200. His opposition to it proves
two things: <i>First,</i> that it was in occasional use,
at least. <i>Second,</i> that it was of recent
origin, since had it been long used some
earlier record if it could be found. <i>Neander,
Ch. Hist., Vol. I., p. 311.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bingham</span> could find no earlier allusion
to it than that of Tertullian, though he believed
it arose earlier. It must, therefore,
as is generally agreed, have had its origin
about the beginning of the <i>third century.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Curcell&aelig;us</span> says: &ldquo;The baptism of infants
in the <i>two first</i> centuries after Christ
was altogether unknown; but in the <i>third</i>
and <i>fourth</i> was allowed by some few. In
the <i>fifth</i> and following ages it was generally
<span class="pagenum" id="p133">[p.&nbsp;133]</span>
received.&rdquo; <i>Inst. Christ. Religion, B. I.,
Ch. 12.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Salmasius</span> says: &ldquo;In the <i>first two</i> centuries
no one was baptized, except, being
instructed in the faith and acquainted with
the doctrines of Christ, he was able to profess
himself a believer.&rdquo; <i>Hist. Bapt. Suicer.
Thesaur., Vol. II., p. 1136.</i></p>

<p>Such testimony is conclusive, and quite
sufficient, though much more of a similar
character might be added.</p>

<p><i>But observe:</i> That when the baptism of
children began, it was not that of unconscious
infants at all, as is now practiced, but,
as Bunsen declares, of &ldquo;little growing children,
from six to ten years old.&rdquo; And he
asserts that Tertullian &ldquo;does not say one
word of new-born infants.&rdquo; Cyprian, an
African bishop, at the close of the <i>third</i> century,
urged the baptism of infants proper,
because of the saving efficacy of the ordinance;
and he is called the inventor, or
father, of infant baptism. <i>Bunsen&rsquo;s Hippol.
and His Age, Vol. III., pp. 192-5.</i></p>

<p class="cgap"><span class="smcap">why did it rise?</span></p>

<p>There is even less difficulty in tracing the
cause than in finding the origin of infant
<span class="pagenum" id="p134">[p.&nbsp;134]</span>
baptism. It originated in a perversion of
Christian doctrine, and was itself the perversion
of a Christian ordinance.</p>

<p>All students of ecclesiastical history know
that at an early period corruptions perverted
Christian faith and practice. Among
these, one of the earliest was that of an
undue efficacy attributed to baptism. Its
sanctity was so exalted that it was believed
to have power to wash away sins, and
cleanse the soul for heaven. By it the sick
were supposed to be prepared for death,
and salvation made more certain by its efficacy.
Anxious parents therefore desired
their dying children to be thus prepared&mdash;&ldquo;washed
in the laver of regeneration,&rdquo; as
it was termed&mdash;that they might be sure of
salvation. And here came in that pernicious
error of &ldquo;baptismal regeneration,&rdquo; which
gave rise to infant baptism, and which has
through all these ages clung with more or
less pertinacity to the clergy and laity of all
churches which have practiced it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Salmasius</span> says: &ldquo;An opinion prevailed
that no one could be saved without being
baptized; and for that reason the custom
arose of baptizing infants.&rdquo; <i>Epist. Jus.
Pac. See Booth&rsquo;s Pedo. Exam., Ch. III.,
Sec. 3.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="p135">[p.&nbsp;135]</span>
<span class="smcap">Venema</span> declares that &ldquo;the ancients connected
a regenerating power with baptism.&rdquo;
He cites Justin Martyr, Iren&aelig;us, Clemens,
Tertullian, and Cyprian as holding that
opinion. <i>Eccl. Hist., Vol. 4, p. 3., Secs. 2,
3, 4.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chrysostom,</span> writing about <span class="smcap">a.&nbsp;d.</span> 398, as
cited by Suicerus, says, &ldquo;It is impossible
without baptism to obtain the kingdom,&rdquo;
and as cited by Wall he says: &ldquo;If sudden
death seize us before we are baptized,
though we have a thousand good qualities,
there is nothing to be expected but hell.&rdquo;
<i>Suicer., Thesaur. Eccl., Vol. I., p. 3.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Waddington,</span> in his Church History,
says, in reference to the <i>third</i> century: &ldquo;A
belief was gaining ground among the converts
and was inculcated among the heathen,
that the act of baptism gave remission
of all sins committed previously.&rdquo; <i>Hist.
of Church, Ch. II., p. 53.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Professor Fisher</span> says: &ldquo;Very early baptism
was so far identified with regeneration
as to be designated by that term. This rite
was considered essential to salvation. A
virtue was believed to reside in the baptismal
water itself.&rdquo; <i>Hist. Christ. Ch., p.
83.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="p136">[p.&nbsp;136]</span>
Do its advocates and supporters hold
the same view now? Do parents and ministers
still believe that the baptism of unconscious
infants secures, or makes more sure,
their salvation? If not, why do they practice
it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Professor Lange&rsquo;s</span> words are weighty,
and should be carefully pondered by Protestant
defenders of this Papal emanation. He
says: &ldquo;Would the Protestant Church fulfill
and attain to its final destiny, the baptism
of new-born children must of necessity be
abolished. It has sunk down to a mere formality,
without any meaning for the child.&rdquo;
<i>History of Protestantism, p. 34.</i></p>

<p>Many good people, familiar with infant
baptism and surrounded by its influences,
have naturally learned to reverence it as of
Divine appointment, and some of them
really believe it is taught or sanctioned by
the New Testament. But Baptists are right
in rejecting it as something utterly without
foundation in the Word of God.</p>

<p class="cgap"><span class="smcap">household baptisms</span></p>

<p>Much stress is laid by some of the advocates
of infant baptism on that fact that in
<span class="pagenum" id="p137">[p.&nbsp;137]</span>
the Acts of the Apostles several cases of
household baptism are mentioned. And it
is asked with an air of assurance: &ldquo;If entire
households were baptized, must there
not have been children among them? And
were they not baptized also?&rdquo; To this it
is sufficient to reply, that nothing is said of
children, and we have no right to put into
the Scriptures what we do not find in them.
All inference that such households contained
infants, and that such infants were baptized,
is the purest fiction in the world. If Christian
institutions could be built on so slight a
foundation as that, we could bring in all
the mummeries of the Greek or the Roman
Church, and all the ceremonies of the Mosaic
ritual.</p>

<p>One thing is certain: If in those households
any children were baptized, they were
old enough to receive the Gospel and to believe
on Christ, and were thus suitable subjects
for the ordinance, and for church fellowship.
For it is said, <i>&ldquo;They believed, and gladly
received the Word.&rdquo;</i> There are thousands
of Baptist churches into whose fellowship
whole households have been baptized&mdash;parents
and children and perhaps others
connected with them. But all were old
enough to <i>believe</i> and to make <i>profession</i> of
<span class="pagenum" id="p138">[p.&nbsp;138]</span>
their faith. So evidently it was in these
households.</p>

<p>The more prominent of these households
are that of Lydia, mentioned in Acts 16;
that of the Philippian jailer, mentioned also
in Acts 16; and that of Stephanas, mentioned
in 1&nbsp;Corinthians 1. Now note what a
few distinguished Pedobaptist scholars say
on these cases.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doctor Neander</span> says: &ldquo;We cannot
prove that the Apostles ordained infant baptism;
from those places where the baptism
of a whole family is mentioned, we can draw
no such conclusion.&rdquo; <i>Planting and Training,
p. 162, N.&nbsp;Y. Ed., 1865.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Professor Jacobi</span> says: &ldquo;In none of
these instances has it been proved that there
were little children among them.&rdquo; <i>Kitto&rsquo;s
Bib. Cyc., Art. Bap.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doctor Meyer</span> says: &ldquo;That the baptism
of children was not in use at that time appears
evident from 1&nbsp;Cor. <span class="wsnw">7:14.</span>&rdquo; <i>Comment.
on Acts <span class="wsnw">16:15.</span></i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doctor De Wette</span> says: &ldquo;This passage
has been adduced in proof of the apostolical
authority of infant baptism: but there is
no proof here that any except adults were
baptized.&rdquo; <i>Com. New Test., Acts <span class="wsnw">16:15.</span></i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="p139">[p.&nbsp;139]</span>
<span class="smcap">Doctor Olshausen</span> says: &ldquo;There is altogether
wanting any conclusive proof-text
for the baptism of infants in the age of the
apostles.&rdquo; <i>Com. on Acts <span class="wsnw">16:15.</span></i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bishop Bloomfield</span> says of the jailer:
&ldquo;It is taken for granted that his family became
Christians as well as himself.&rdquo; <i>Com.
on Acts <span class="wsnw">16:15.</span></i></p>

<p>Calvin, Doddridge, Henry, and other
commentators declare that in this case the
household all believed, and therefore were
baptized and did rejoice. MacKnight considers
the case of the household of Stephanas
as giving no countenance to the baptism of
infants. And with him agree Guise, Hammond,
Doddridge, and others.</p>

<p>As to the argument used by some, that
baptism came in the place of circumcision,
it is too weak and puerile, too far-fetched
and destitute of reason, to claim the serious
regard of intelligent and candid minds.</p>

<h3 class="tdc" id="ch13">CHAPTER XIII</h3>

<p class="tdc"><span class="smcap">church government</span></p>

<p>A Christian church is a society with a
corporate life, organized on some definite
plan, adapted to some definite purpose, which
it proposes to accomplish. It has, therefore,
its officers and ordinances, its laws and regulations,
fitted to administer its government
and carry out its purposes. The question
then arises, What is the true and proper
form of church organization and government?
We do not care to inquire as to the
various and contradictory forms, as we see
them about us in the different denominations,
but what was the organic form and
government of the first churches, planted
by and molded under the hands of Christ&rsquo;s
inspired Apostles.</p>

<p>There are <i>three</i> special and widely different
forms of church government which have
gained prevalence in Christian communities
during past age, and which are still maintained
with varied success, each of which
<span class="pagenum" id="p141">[p.&nbsp;141]</span>
claims to have been the original primitive
form:</p>

<p>1. The <i>prelatical,</i> in which the governing
power resides in prelates, or diocesan
bishops, and the higher clergy; as in the
Roman, Greek, English, and most Oriental
churches.</p>

<p>2. The <i>presbyterian,</i> in which the governing
power resides in assemblies, synods,
presbyteries, and sessions; as in the Scottish
Kirk, the Lutheran, and the various Presbyterian
churches.</p>

<p>3. The <i>independent,</i> in which the body
is self-governing, each single and local
church administering its own government
by the voice of the majority of its members;
as among Baptists, Congregationalists,
Independents, and some other bodies.</p>

<p>Now which of these modes of church
life and administration is taught in the New
Testament, if either? or which best accords
with the constitution and government of the
Apostolic churches?</p>

<p>Baptists hold that each separate, local
church is an independent body, governing
itself according to the laws of Christ, as
found in the New Testament; that each
<span class="pagenum" id="p142">[p.&nbsp;142]</span>
such church is independent of all other
churches, and of all other persons, so far as
administration is concerned, owing comity
and fellowship to all, but allegiance and
submission to none. The government is
administered by the body of the members,
where no one possesses a preeminence of
authority, but each enjoys an equality of
rights, and in which, in matters of opinion,
the majority decides.</p>

<p>That this style of church structure is
according to the New Testament appears
evident from a study of the sacred records
themselves. The Apostles treated the
churches as independent bodies. Their
epistles were addressed to the churches
as such; they reported their doings to
them; enjoined upon them the duty of
discipline; exhorted, instructed, and reproved
them as independent and responsible
bodies. They recognized the right of the
churches to elect their own teachers and
officers, a primary and fundamental right,
which, when conceded supposes all other
rights and powers necessary to a self-governing
community acting under Divinely
given laws.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Neander,</span> the distinguished historian, says
of the first age: &ldquo;The churches were taught
<span class="pagenum" id="p143">[p.&nbsp;143]</span>
to govern themselves.&rdquo; &ldquo;The brethren
chose their own officers from among themselves.&rdquo;
&ldquo;In respect to the election of
church officers, the ancient principle was
still adhered to: that the consent of the
community was necessary to the validity of
every such election, and each one was at
liberty to offer reasons against it.&rdquo; <i>Introd.
Coleman&rsquo;s Prim. Christ&rsquo;y, p. 19; Ch.
Hist., Vol. I., p. 199; Plant. and Train.,
p. 156.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mosheim</span> says of the first century: &ldquo;In
those primitive times, each Christian Church
was composed of the <i>people,</i> the presiding
<i>officers,</i> and the assistants, or <i>deacons.</i>
These must be the component parts of every
society. The principal voice was that of the
<i>people,</i> or of the whole body of Christians.&rdquo;
&ldquo;The assembled people, therefore, elected
their own rulers and teachers.&rdquo; Of the
second century, he adds: &ldquo;One president,
or bishop, presides over each church. He
was created by the common suffrages of the
people.&rdquo; &ldquo;During a great part of this century,
all the churches continued to be, as at
first, <i>independent</i> of each other. Each
church was a kind of small, independent republic,
governing itself by its own laws,
enacted, or at least sanctioned, by the people.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum" id="p144">[p.&nbsp;144]</span>
<i>Eccl. Hist., Cent. 1, Part 1, Ch. 2, Sec.
5, 6; Cent. 2, Ch. 2, Sec. 1, 2.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Coleman</span> says: &ldquo;These churches, wherever
formed, became separate and independent
bodies, competent to appoint their own
officers and administer their own government
without reference or subordination to
any control, authority or foreign power.
No fact connected with the history of the
primitive church is more fully established
or more generally conceded.&rdquo; <i>Prim. Christ.
Exemp., Ch. 4, Sec. 4, p. 95.</i></p>

<p>Archbishop Whately, Doctor Barrow,
Doctor Burton, Doctor Waddington&mdash;all of
them Church of England Divines&mdash;fully
agree with this testimony, and confirm the
evidence cited:</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Geiseler,</span> the historian, says, concerning
early changes: &ldquo;Country churches, which
had grown up around some city, seem, with
their bishops, to have been usually, in a
certain degree, under the authority of the
mother church. With this exception, all the
churches were alike independent, though
some were especially held in honor, on such
grounds as their Apostolic origin, or the importance
of the city in which they were
situated.&rdquo; <i>Ch. Hist., Period 1, Div. 1, Ch. 3, Sec. 52.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="p145">[p.&nbsp;145]</span>
Further discussion on this subject is not
needed. The point is proved, and the independent
form of church government is manifestly
primitive and apostolic, as advocated
and practiced by Baptists.</p>

<hr />

<p>&nbsp;<span class="pagenum" id="p146">[p.&nbsp;146]</span></p>
<h3 class="tdc" id="ch14">CHAPTER XIV</h3>

<p class="tdc"><span class="smcap">church officers</span></p>

<p>How many, and what are the Scriptural
officers of a Christian church? For a
church, being a society, must have not only
laws, but officers to execute them. How
many orders are there in the ministry?
These are questions which have at times
greatly divided the Christian world.</p>

<p>Baptists assert that the officers of a church
are <i>two,</i>&mdash;and of right, can be no more,&mdash;<i>pastor</i>
and <i>deacons.</i> In this opinion agree
some other denominations, while the various
Episcopal sects insist that there should be
three sets&mdash;<i>deacons, priests,</i> and <i>bishops,</i> to
which the Church of England adds archbishops.
Others add to this number indefinitely;
and the Romish Church carries
the list up to ten or twelve, ending with the
pope. Now it is not so much what this
church preaches or practices, but on what
basis were the primitive churches&mdash;the
churches of inspiration&mdash;organized. Our
<span class="pagenum" id="p147">[p.&nbsp;147]</span>
Lord did not live to shape, and model, and
put in order all things for the full equipment
of His people, that they might be
thoroughly furnished unto all good works,
but He did give to His Apostles a spirit of
wisdom by which they should be able to do
all this, and carry out His plans, in the organization
of His kingdom after He had left
them. We assume that the first churches
were organized on the Divine plan, and seek
to ascertain what that plan was.</p>

<p>In the New Testament, the words <i>bishop,
presbyter, elder,</i> are used to designate church
officers. They all, however, designate the
same office, and therefore officially mean
the same thing; indeed, they are not infrequently
applied to the same individual.
The bishop&mdash;called also the presbyter, or elder&mdash;was
the <i>pastor,</i> or overseer of the spiritual
flock, watching, guiding, and feeding it,
as the shepherd does his sheep. The <i>deacons</i>
were chosen to attend to the temporal interests
of the church, as appears by the election
of the seven, recorded in the sixth chapter
of Acts. This was done in order that the
Apostles might be free from the temporal
cares, and thus able to give their attention
more exclusively to the spiritual welfare of
the people. The word <i>deacon</i> means a <i>minister,</i>
<span class="pagenum" id="p148">[p.&nbsp;148]</span>
a <i>servant.</i> It is sometimes applied to
the Apostles, and even to Christ himself, in
the general sense as one who &ldquo;came, not to
be ministered unto, but to minister, and to
give His life a ransom for many.&rdquo; Some of
the first deacons were also efficient preachers
of the Gospel, but their work as deacons
pertained to other services in the churches.
While, therefore, the deacon is a church
officer, his office does not constitute an order
in the ministry at all, its functions belonging
to temporal concerns, and not to a spiritual
service. The service usually performed
by clerks, trustees, and the like, it may be
presumed, so far as such service was needed
in the first churches, was devolved on the
deacons.</p>

<p>Pastors, by whatever name they may
have been known, had the same service,
and were of the same grade, dignity, and
authority. In the first churches there were
no high orders of clergy placed over lower
grades, and over the churches ruling with
superior authority. All were equals among
equals, and all equally ministered to the
churches. If in the same church there
might chance to be several to whom the
titles <i>bishop, presbyter,</i> or <i>elder</i> were applied,
they were all of equal rank or authority,
<span class="pagenum" id="p149">[p.&nbsp;149]</span>
though one might be selected to serve as
the pastor of the church, and devote himself
to its local interests; while the others
might give themselves to more general missionary
work.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Neander</span> says: &ldquo;The word <i>presbyter,</i> or
<i>elder,</i> indicates rather the dignity of the
office, since presbyters among the Jews were
usually aged and venerable; while <i>bishop,</i>
or <span lang="grc-Latn">episcopos,</span> designated the nature of their
work as overseers, or pastors of the
churches. The former title was used by
Jewish Christians as a name familiar in the
synagogue; while the latter was chiefly used
by the Greek and other Gentile converts, as
more familiar and expressive to them.&rdquo;
&ldquo;They were not designed to exercise absolute
authority, but to act as presiding officers
and guides of an ecclesiastical republic: to
conduct all things, with the cooperation of
the communities, as their ministers and not
as their masters.&rdquo; <i>Introd. to Cole., Prim.
Ch., p. 20; Ch. Hist., Vol. 1., p. 184; Plant.
and Train., p. 147.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mosheim</span> says: &ldquo;The rulers of the
churches were denominated sometimes <i>presbyters,</i>
or <i>elders,</i> a designation borrowed
from the Jews, and indicative rather of the
<span class="pagenum" id="p150">[p.&nbsp;150]</span>
wisdom than the age of the persons, and
sometimes also <i>bishops:</i> for it is most manifest
that both terms are promiscuously used
in the New Testament of one and the same
class of persons.&rdquo; &ldquo;In these primitive
times, each Christian church was composed
of the <i>people,</i> the presiding <i>officers,</i> and the
assistants, or <i>deacons.</i> These must be the
components of every society.&rdquo; <i>Eccl. Hist.,
Cent 1., p. 2; Ch. 2, Secs. 5, 8.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gieseler</span> asserts: &ldquo;The new churches
everywhere formed themselves on the model
of the mother church at Jerusalem. At the
head of each were the <i>elders</i> (<i>presbyter,
bishop</i>), all officially of equal rank, though
in several instances a peculiar authority
seems to have been conceded to some one
individual from personal considerations.&rdquo;
<i>Ch. Hist., Part 1, Div. 1, Ch. 2, Sec. 29.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Waddington</span> declares: &ldquo;It is also true
that in the earliest government of the first
Christian society,&mdash;that of Jerusalem,&mdash;not
the <i>elders</i> only, but the &lsquo;whole church,&rsquo;
were associated with the Apostles; and it is
even certain that the terms <i>bishop</i> and <i>elder,</i>
or <i>presbyter,</i> were in the first instance and
for a short period, sometimes used synonymously,
and indiscriminately applied to the
<span class="pagenum" id="p151">[p.&nbsp;151]</span>
same order in the ministry.&rdquo; <i>Hist. Christ.

<p><span class="smcap">Archbishop Usher</span> says that &ldquo;<i>bishop</i>
and <i>presbyter</i> differed only in degree, and
not in order.&rdquo; See <i>Cole., Anc. Christ.

<p><span class="smcap">Bishop Burnett</span> says: &ldquo;As for the
notion of distinct offices of <i>bishop</i> and <i>presbyter,</i>
I confess it is not so clear to me.&rdquo;
<i>Vindic. Ch. of Sects, p. 366.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doctor Coleman</span> says: &ldquo;It is generally
admitted by Episcopal writers on this subject,
that in the New Testament, and in the
earliest ecclesiastical writings, the terms
<i>bishops</i> and <i>presbyters,</i> or elders, are synonymous,
and denote one and the same
office.&rdquo; &ldquo;The office of <i>presbyter</i> was undeniably
identical with that of <i>bishop,</i> as has
been shown above.&rdquo; &ldquo;Only <i>two orders</i> of
officers are known in the church until the
close of the second century. Those of the
first are styled either <i>bishops</i> or <i>presbyters;</i>
of the second, <i>deacons.</i>&rdquo; <i>Anc. Christ. Exemp.,
Ch. 8, Sec. 6; Ch. 6, Sec. 5.</i></p>

<p>This author cites many of the early Christian
Fathers who bore the same testimony,
among whom are Clement of Rome, Polycarp,
Justin Martyr, Iren&aelig;us, Jerome,
<span class="pagenum" id="p152">[p.&nbsp;152]</span>
Chrysostom, Theodoret, and others. Many
prelatical writers, besides these above
quoted, frankly admit the same facts.</p>

<p>The Apostle Paul, it is stated (Acts <span class="wsnw">20:17,</span> 18),
called together the <i>elders</i> (<i>presbyters</i>)
of the Ephesian Church. But in verse
28 he calls these officers <i>overseers</i> (<span lang="grc-Latn">episcopos</span>).
Here the terms <span lang="grc-Latn">presbuteros</span> and
<span lang="grc-Latn">episcopos</span> were certainly used interchangeably.</p>

<p>Paul and Timothy, in their address to the
Philippian Christians, specify three classes
as evidently constituting the entire body of
disciples. They say, &ldquo;To all the <i>saints</i> in
Christ Jesus, which are at Philippi, with the
<i>bishops</i> and <i>deacons.</i>&rdquo; Saints, bishops, and
deacons embraced the whole church.</p>

<p>Timothy was instructed by Paul as to
the qualifications of pastors to be placed
over the churches. (1&nbsp;Tim. <span class="wsnw">3:1.)</span> Particular
directions are given as to both
<i>bishops</i> and <i>deacons,</i> but no mention is made
of elders&mdash;clearly because they were the
same as bishops.</p>

<p>Titus is likewise enjoined to secure pastors
for the church in Crete. (Titus <span class="wsnw">1:5,</span> 7.)
These pastors are called <i>elders</i> in verse
5 and <i>bishops</i> in verse 7.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="p153">[p.&nbsp;153]</span>
<i>Pastors</i> and <i>deacons,</i> therefore, are two
orders, and these officers simply were known
or needed in the Apostolic churches. In
this, also, the views held by Baptists are in
harmony with the customs of the churches
in the first and purest age of Christian history.</p>

<h3 class="tdc" id="ch15">CHAPTER XV</h3>

<p class="tdc"><span class="smcap">baptist history</span></p>

<p>It is sometimes asked: &ldquo;When and
where did the Baptists originate? Who
were their founders? What is their history?&rdquo;
These are questions of interest;
but a more important one would be: &ldquo;Are
they right? Is their faith according to the
teachings of the New Testament?&rdquo; Many
things which are old are not true. Creeds
and sects may boast a venerable antiquity,
while the Word of God utterly condemns
them. Any organization that cannot reasonably
claim Christ for its founder has
small right to the name of a Christian
church, no matter how old it may be.</p>

<p>Baptists claim to be built on the foundation
of the Apostles and prophets, Jesus
Christ Himself being the chief Corner-Stone.
If this claim be well founded, whether they
have a written history of one century or of
twenty, matters little. Yet whatever of the
past belongs to any, it may be well to know.
<span class="pagenum" id="p155">[p.&nbsp;155]</span>
Any Baptist history constitutes one of the
most interesting chapters in the records of
Christianity.</p>

<p>During the Apostolic age even, the doctrines
of the Gospel became corrupted, and
its ordinances soon after. Both Jewish and
Gentile converts brought into the churches
many of their old religious notions, and
incorporated them with the faith of Christ.
These, together with the many philosophical
ideas of the times and the perversions to
which the truth is always exposed from the
ignorance and selfishness of men, very early
turned the churches aside from the faith
once delivered to the saints. Still there
were many who in simplicity and humility
maintained the doctrines and customs in
their original purity. Those churches which
were strongest and most prosperous were
most exposed to corruption by alliances with
the world.</p>

<p>When at length the period of martyrdom
and persecution terminated; when a nominal
Christianity took possession of a throne,
and Church and State became united, then
religion, in its prevailing forms, lost its simplicity,
its spirituality, and its power, and a
temporal hierarchy took the place of the
church of Christ. This was the great apostasy
<span class="pagenum" id="p156">[p.&nbsp;156]</span>
of the early times. But all the churches
and all disciples did not follow in the wake
of this sad departure from the truth. Many
congregations and communities of true worshipers
kept the doctrines of the Gospel, and
practiced its ordinances, nearly, or quite in
their primitive purity. And this they continued
to do through all the ages of darkness
and corruption which followed. They
were never identified with the Roman or
Greek churches; they never were in alliance
with States; never formed hierarchies. As
independent congregations, or small communities,
with no other bond of union than a
common faith, fellowship, and sympathy,
often obscure and unobtrusive, taking the
Word of God as their guide, they sought to
realize the idea, not of a temporal, but a
spiritual kingdom in the Gospel dispensation.</p>

<p>These religious communities were by the
dominant hierarchies called <i>sects,</i> and stigmatized
as <i>heretics.</i> As such they were
traduced and persecuted continually. And
though they may have had their errors,
they were the best and purest defenders of
the Christian faith, and the truest representatives
of the first disciples of Christ then
existing. The State churches were the
<span class="pagenum" id="p157">[p.&nbsp;157]</span>
heretics; while those so-called sects were the
true successors of the first Christians.</p>

<p>They were defamed and oppressed, calumniated
and martyred because they bore
witness to the truth of God and testified
against the errors and vices of the so-called
churches. History has never done them
justice, and perhaps never will; because
history has been too much written in the
interest of their enemies, or from their
standpoint. Tortured and tormented by
those who should have been their defenders,
crowns and miters alike pledged to their
destruction, they could do nothing but
suffer. And this they nobly did as Christ&rsquo;s
faithful witnesses. They were known by
various names in different ages and in different
lands, but retained the same general
characteristics.</p>

<p>In the <i>first</i> and <i>second</i> centuries, Messalians,
Montanists, Euchites, were terms
which distinguished some of these sects.</p>

<p>In the <i>third, fourth,</i> and <i>fifth</i> centuries
arose the Novatians. Increasing with exceeding
rapidity, they quite overspread the
Roman empire, in spite of the cruel and
destructive persecutions which they suffered.</p>

<p>In the <i>fourth</i> century the Donatists appeared,
as a new form of existing sects, or
<span class="pagenum" id="p158">[p.&nbsp;158]</span>
a new phase of the old faith. They multiplied
rapidly, spread extensively, and long
survived.</p>

<p>In the <i>seventh</i> century appeared the Paulicians,
attracting much attention, and calling
down upon themselves the wrath of the
Romish Church. Still they increased
greatly, notwithstanding their many persecutions.</p>

<p>That these Christian communities should
have been faultless could not be supposed.
But they were the best of the ages in which
they lived, and maintained the purest forms
of Gospel truth and practice. Without
the advantage of organization and association,
they differed somewhat among themselves.</p>

<p>But in general they all professed to take
the New Testament as the rule of their
faith and practice. They held to a spiritual
church-membership, and received only professedly
regenerated persons to the ordinances.
Denying the orthodoxy of the
Romish Church, they rebaptized persons
received from that body, and hence were
called <i>Anabaptists.</i> Infant baptism they
rejected, according to Allix, Mosheim, Robinson,
and other historians. Baptism they
administered by immersion, as indeed did
<span class="pagenum" id="p159">[p.&nbsp;159]</span>
all Christians during those ages. Robinson
calls them &ldquo;Trinitarian Baptists.&rdquo; It is
said that the Empress Theodora, after
having confiscated their property, caused
to be cruelly put to death no less than
one hundred thousand Paulicians, for no
other fault or offense than their religious
faith.</p>

<p>About the close of the <i>tenth</i> century appeared
the Paterines; substantially the
same people, no doubt as had previously
existed under other names. They too rejected
infant baptism, and protested against
the corruptions of the Romish Church; in
consequence of which they suffered long and
severe persecution.</p>

<p>In the <i>eleventh</i> century, and the ages following,
were the Waldenses, Albigenses,
Vaudois, Cathari, and Poor Men of Lyons.
These were new names, and names usually
given by their enemies. They increased,
even under their persecutions, to a wonderful
extent, and attracted the notice, if not
the sympathy, of all Europe.</p>

<p>It is not pretended that these ancient
sects were known by the name as Baptists; but
in general they held the more prominent
and distinctive principles which have always
characterized the Baptists; thus: 1.&nbsp;They
<span class="pagenum" id="p160">[p.&nbsp;160]</span>
declared and defended the rights of faith
and conscience and the freedom of worship.
2.&nbsp;They denied the authority of popes and
the right of kings and States to interfere
with the people in matters of religion.
3.&nbsp;They rejected infant baptism. 4.&nbsp;They baptized
by dipping. 5.&nbsp;They held the Bible to
be the only rule and authority in concerns of
religious faith and practice. 6.&nbsp;They admitted
to the churches none except such as
professed to be regenerated and godly persons.</p>

<p>Now it is conceded by all historians of
note that such churches and communities
did exist, separate from and persecuted by,
the prevailing State churches and civil
authorities during all the ages from the
Apostles to the Reformation.</p>

<p>When the Reformation under Luther and
his coadjutors broke out, these sects to a
great extent fraternized with, and were lost
in, the multitude of the reformers. Such as
continued their separate existence, as the
Waldenses of Piedmont, yielding to the influence
of the reformers, did from sympathy
what the persecutions of the Papists had
never been able to compel them to do&mdash;abandon
dipping for sprinkling in baptism,
adopted infant baptism, and took the
<span class="pagenum" id="p161">[p.&nbsp;161]</span>
general forms of religious life, into which
Pedobaptist Protestantism grew.</p>

<p class="cgap"><span class="smcap">the welsh baptists</span></p>

<p>Few denominations have a better claim
to antiquity than the Welsh Baptists. They
trace their descent directly from the
Apostles and urge in favor of their claim
arguments which have never been confuted.</p>

<p>When Austin, the Romish monk and
missionary, visited Wales, at the close of
the <i>sixth</i> century, he found a community of
more than two thousand Christians, quietly
living in their mountain homes. They
were independent of the Romish See, and
wholly rejected its authority. Austin
labored hard to convert them&mdash;that is, to
bring them under the Papal yoke; but entirely
failed in the effort. Yielding things
in general, he reduced his demand upon
them to three particulars: 1.&nbsp;That they
should observe Easter in due form, as ordered
by the Church. 2.&nbsp;That they should
give Christendom, or baptism, to their children.
3.&nbsp;That they should preach to the
English the Word of God, as
<span class="wsnw">directed.<a id="ch15_fna1"></a><a class="fnanchor" href="#ch15_fn1">[1]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="p162">[p.&nbsp;162]</span>
These demands of Austin prove that they
neither observed the Popish ordinance of
Easter, nor baptized their children. They,
however, rejected all his overtures, whereupon
he left them with threats of war and
wretchedness. Not long after, Wales was
invaded by the Saxons, and many of these
inoffensive Christians cruelly murdered, as
was believed, at the instigation of this
bigoted zealot, the exacting Austin.</p>

<p class="cgap"><span class="smcap">the dutch baptists</span></p>

<p>The Baptists of Holland have a history
that reaches back to a very remote period,
if not to the Apostolic age, as some confidently
assert. And this antiquity is conceded
by historians who have no sympathy
with their denominational sentiments.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mosheim,</span> in his Church History, says,
&ldquo;The true origin of that sect which
acquired the name Anabaptist <i>is hid in the
remote depths of antiquity,</i> and is consequently
extremely difficult to be ascertained.&rdquo;
<i>Eccl. Hist., Vol. IV., p. 427,
Mac. Ed., 1811.</i> See <i>Introd. Orchard&rsquo;s
Hist. Bap., p. 17.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Zwingli,</span> the Swiss Reformer, contemporary
<span class="pagenum" id="p163">[p.&nbsp;163]</span>
with Luther, declares: &ldquo;The institution
of Anabaptism is no novelty but for
<i>thirteen hundred years</i> has caused great disturbance
in the church.&rdquo; <i>Introd. Orchard&rsquo;s
Hist. Bap., p. 17.</i> Thirteen hundred years
before his time would have carried it back
to within two centuries of the death of
Christ.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doctor Dermont,</span> chaplain to the king
of Holland, and Doctor Ypeij, professor of
theology at Groningen, a few years since
received a royal commission to prepare a
history of the Reformed Dutch Church.
That history, prepared under royal sanction,
and officially published, contains the following
manly and generous testimony to the
antiquity and orthodoxy of the Dutch Baptists.
&ldquo;We have now seen that the Baptists,
who were formerly called Anabaptists, and
in later times Mennonites, were the original
Waldenses, and have long in the history of
the church received the honor of that origin.
On this account, <i>the Baptists may be considered
the only Christian community which has
stood since the Apostles, and as a Christian
society, which has preserved pure the doctrines
of the Gospel through all ages.&rdquo; Hist.
Ref. Dutch Ch., Ed. Breda, 1819.</i> See
<i>Ency. Relig. Knowledge, Art. Mennonites.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="p164">[p.&nbsp;164]</span>
<span class="smcap">Mosheim</span> says of the persecutions of this
people in the sixteenth century, &ldquo;Vast
numbers of these people, in nearly all the
countries of Europe, would rather perish
miserably by drowning, hanging, burning,
or decapitation, than renounce the opinions
they had embraced.&rdquo; And their
innocency he vindicates thus: &ldquo;It is
indeed true that many Anabaptists were
put to death, not as being bad citizens,
or injurious members of civil society,
but as being incurable <i>heretics,</i> who were
condemned by the old canon laws. For
the error of <i>adult baptism</i> was in that
age looked upon as a horrible offense.&rdquo;
That was their only crime. <i>Eccl. Hist.,
Cent. 16, Sec. 3. Part 2, Ch. iii. Fuller&rsquo;s
Ch. Hist., B. 4.</i></p>

<p>This testimony is all the more welcome,
because it comes from those who have no
ecclesiastical sympathies with Baptists, but
who, in fidelity to history, bear honest testimony
to the truth which history teaches.
The circumstances under which their evidence
was produced give it additional
force.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cardinal Hossius,</span> chairman of the
council at Trent, says: &ldquo;If the truth of
<span class="pagenum" id="p165">[p.&nbsp;165]</span>
religion were to be judged of by the readiness
and cheerfulness which a man of any
sect shows in suffering, then the opinions
and persuasions of no sect can be truer or
surer, than those of the <i>Anabaptists;</i> since
there have been none, for these <i>twelve hundred
years past,</i> that have been more grievously
punished.&rdquo; <i>Orchard&rsquo;s Hist. Bap.,
Sec. 12, part 30, p. 364.</i></p>

<p>Many thousands of the Dutch Baptists,
called Anabaptists, and Mennonites, miserably
perished by the hands of their cruel
persecutors, for no crime but their refusal
to conform to established
<span class="wsnw">churches.<a id="ch15_fna2"></a><a class="fnanchor" href="#ch15_fn2">[2]</a></span></p>

<p class="cgap"><span class="smcap">the english baptists</span></p>

<p>At what time the Baptists appeared in
England in definite denominational form, it
is impossible to say. But from the <i>twelfth</i>
to the <i>seventeenth</i> century, many of them
suffered cruel persecutions, and death by
burning, drowning, and beheading, besides
many other, and sometimes most inhuman
tortures. And this they suffered both from
Papists and Protestants, condemned by both
civil and ecclesiastical tribunals, only because
<span class="pagenum" id="p166">[p.&nbsp;166]</span>
they persisted in worshiping God, according
to the dictates of their consciences,
and because they would not submit their religious
faith and worship to the dictates of
popes and <span class="wsnw">princes.<a id="ch15_fna3"></a><a class="fnanchor" href="#ch15_fn3">[3]</a></span>
In 1538, royal edicts
were issued against them, and several were
burnt at the stake in Smithfield.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Brande</span> writes that: &ldquo;In the year 1538,
thirty-one Baptists, that fled from England,
were put to death at Delft, in Holland; the
men were beheaded, the women were
drowned.&rdquo; <i>Hist. Reformers.</i> See <i>Benedict&rsquo;s
Hist. Bap., p. 303. Neal&rsquo;s Hist. Puritans,
Vol. I., p. 138. Note, Vol. II, p. 355,
Sup.</i> What crime had they committed to
merit such treatment as this?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bishop Latimer</span> declares that, &ldquo;The
Baptists that were burnt in different parts
of the kingdom went to death intrepidly, and
without any fear, during the time of Henry
VIII.&rdquo; <i>Lent Sermons. Neal&rsquo;s Hist. Purit.,
Vol. II, p. 356.</i></p>

<p>Under the rule of the Popish Mary, they
suffered perhaps no more than under that of
the Protestant Elizabeth. During the reign
of the latter a congregation of Baptists was
<span class="pagenum" id="p167">[p.&nbsp;167]</span>
discovered in London, whereupon several
were banished, twenty-seven imprisoned,
and two burnt at
<span class="wsnw">Smithfield.<a id="ch15_fna4"></a><a class="fnanchor" href="#ch15_fn4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doctor Featley,</span> one of their bitter enemies,
wrote of them, in 1633: &ldquo;This sect,
among others, hath so far presumed upon
the patience of the State, that it hath held
weekly conventicles, rebaptizing hundreds
of men and women together in the twilight,
in rivulets and in some arms of the
Thames, and elsewhere, dipping them all
over head and ears. It hath printed divers
pamphlets in defense of their heresy; yea,
and challenged some of our preachers to disputation.&rdquo;
<i>Eng. Bapt. Jubilee Memor.,
Benedict&rsquo;s Hist. Bapt., p. 304.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bailey</span> wrote, in 1639, that: &ldquo;Under
the shadow of independency they have lifted
up their heads, and increased their numbers
above all sects in the land. They have
<i>forty-six churches</i> in and about London.
They are a people very fond of religious
liberty, and very unwilling to be brought
under bondage of the judgment of others.&rdquo;
<i>Benedict&rsquo;s History, p. 304.</i></p>

<p>The first book published in the English
<span class="pagenum" id="p168">[p.&nbsp;168]</span>
language on the subject of baptism was
translated from the Dutch, and bears date
1618. From this time they multiplied
rapidly through all parts of the kingdom.
The first regularly organized church among
them, known as such in England, dates
from 1607, and was formed in London by
a Mr. Smyth, previously a clergyman of
the Established Church.</p>

<p>In 1689, the Particular Baptists, so called,
held a convention in London, in which more
than one hundred congregations were represented,
and which issued a confession of
faith, still in use and highly esteemed.</p>

<p>The last Baptist martyr in England was
Edward Wightman, of Burton upon Trent,
condemned by the Bishop of Coventry, and
burnt at Litchfield, April 11,
<span class="wsnw">1612.<a id="ch15_fna5"></a><a class="fnanchor" href="#ch15_fn5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p class="cgap"><span class="smcap">american baptists</span></p>

<p>The history of American Baptists runs
back a little more than two and a quarter
centuries. In this country, as elsewhere,
they were cradled amidst persecution, and
nurtured by the hatred of their foes. This
has been their fortune in every age, and in
every land.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="p169">[p.&nbsp;169]</span>
<span class="smcap">Roger Williams,</span> a distinguished and
an honored name, was identified with the
rise of the denomination in America. He
has been called their founder, because he organized
the first church, and was intimately
connected with their early history. Williams
was born in Wales, 1598, educated at
Oxford, England, came to America in 1630,
and settled as minister of the Puritan church
in Salem, Massachusetts. Not long after, he
adopted Baptist views of doctrine and church
order, on account of which he was banished
by his fellow Puritans, and driven out of
Massachusetts, in the depths of a rigorous
winter, in a new and inhospitable country.
Having wandered far and suffered much,
finding the savage Indians more generous
and hospitable than his fellow Christians,
he finally reached and fixed his future home
at what is now Providence, R.&nbsp;I. Here,
with a few associates of like faith, he founded
a new colony, calling both the city and the
colony <i>Providence,</i> in recognition of the
Divine guidance and protection, which he
had in so remarkable a manner experienced.</p>

<p>In 1639, Mr. Williams received baptism
from one of his associates, there being no
minister to perform that service. He in
turn baptized his associates, and a church
<span class="pagenum" id="p170">[p.&nbsp;170]</span>
was organized, of which he was chosen
pastor. He was also appointed first Governor
of Rhode Island. Full liberty was
granted in matters of religion. Thus Roger
Williams became the first ruler, and Rhode
Island the first State which ever gave entire
freedom to all persons to worship God,
according to their own choice, without dictation
or interference from civil or ecclesiastical
authorities.</p>

<p>On account of this unrestricted liberty
many Baptists, as well as other persecuted
religionists from other colonies, and from
Europe, collected in considerable numbers
at Providence, and spread through the
colony.</p>

<p>It is a mistake to suppose that all the
Baptist churches in America grew out of the
one which Roger Williams founded. It is
even doubtful whether any single church
arose as an outgrowth of that. As immigration
increased, other churches grew up,
having no connection with that; and with
considerable rapidity the sentiments of Baptists
spread into adjoining colonies, particularly
west and south. For a long time,
however, they were sorely persecuted, especially
in Massachusetts and Connecticut;
persecuted even by those who had themselves
<span class="pagenum" id="p171">[p.&nbsp;171]</span>
fled from persecution in their native
land, to find freedom and refuge in these
distant wilds.</p>

<p>In 1644, the present First Church in
Newport, R.&nbsp;I., was organized. But
whether the present First Church in Providence
was constituted before this date is
still a disputed point. Both claim priority.
In 1656, the Second Church, Newport, was
formed. Then followed in order of time
the church in Swansea, Massachusetts,
1663; First, Boston, 1665; North Kingstone,
R.&nbsp;I., 1665; Seventh Day Church,
Newport, 1671; South Kingstone, R.&nbsp;I.,
1680; Kittery, Me., 1682; Middletown,
N.&nbsp;J., 1688; Lower Dublin, Pa., 1689;
Charleston, S.&nbsp;C., 1690; Philadelphia, Pa.,
1698; Welsh Tract, Del., 1701; Groton,
Ct., 1705. Others, not mentioned, arose
within this period in these and other colonies.
With the increase of population, Baptists
rapidly increased and widely spread
over the country.</p>

<p><i>Edward&rsquo;s Tables</i> gives the number of
American Baptist Churches in 1768, as
only 137.</p>

<p><i>Asplund&rsquo;s Register</i> for 1790, reported
872 churches, 722 ordained ministers, with
64,975 members.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="p172">[p.&nbsp;172]</span>
<i>Benedict&rsquo;s History</i> states that in 1812,
there were 2,633 churches, 2,143 ordained
ministers, and 204,185 members.</p>

<p><i>Allen&rsquo;s Register</i> for 1836, puts them at
7,299 churches, 4.075 ordained ministers,
and 517,523 members.</p>

<p><i>The Baptist Year-Book</i> gives the following

<p><i>The Year-Book</i> gives the Sunday school
statistics for 1930, as follows: For the
United States, schools, 46,132; total enrollment
5,143,056.</p>

<p>The figures given in all these cases are
probably less than the actual facts warrant,
since full reports from associations,
churches, and schools can never be obtained.</p>

<p class="cgap"><span class="smcap">other baptists</span></p>

<p>Besides the regular Baptist Brotherhood,
there are in the United States very many
<span class="pagenum" id="p173">[p.&nbsp;173]</span>
other and smaller denominations, which
practice immersion, but are not in fellowship
with, or reckoned as a part of, the great
Baptist family.</p>

<p>The Seventh Day Baptists, so called on
account of their observing Saturday, or the
seventh day of the week, as their Sabbath,
on the ground that the Jewish Sabbath was
never abrogated. They are estimated at
about 7,000.</p>

<p>The Free Will Baptists, who take their
name from their views as to the freedom
of the human will and practice open communion,
number about 66,000. In the North
the Free Will Baptist churches have generally
united with the Northern Convention,
and their membership is reckoned with that
of the regular Baptist body.</p>

<p>The Six Principle Baptists, so called because
their doctrinal confession is based on
the six points mentioned in Hebrews <span class="wsnw">6:1,</span>
2, are estimated at about 300.</p>

<p>The Anti-Mission Baptists, or rather
Primitive Baptists, found chiefly in the
Southwest, do not believe in missions, Sunday
schools, or other reform movements lest
they should seem to interfere with the Divine
decrees. They are said to number
43,000.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="p174">[p.&nbsp;174]</span>
The Disciples of Christ, sometimes called
Campbellites, or Christians, number about
1,200,000.</p>

<p>The Winebrennerians, or the General Eldership
of the Churches of God in North
America, are estimated at about 30,000.</p>

<p>The Tunkers, or Dunkards, of all groups
number about 126,000, and the United
Brethren, about 330,000.</p>

<p class="cgap"><span class="smcap">baptists elsewhere</span></p>

<p>In North America, aside from the United
States, but including the provinces of British
America, Central America, Mexico, and the
West Indies, Baptists numbered in 1930
about 249,809.</p>

<p>In Europe there were in 1930 about
1,639,656.</p>

<p>In Asia, about 361,800.</p>

<p>In Australasia, about 35,113.</p>

<p>In Africa, about 83,041.</p>
